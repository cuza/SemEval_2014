If the Bank of England had cut rates, said Philippe Legrain, the chief economist for Britain in Europe, a pro-euro advocacy group, the pound would have fallen further.
``The real message,'' said Barry Bright, an Ernst &amp; Young spokesman, in a press release, ``is that overall economic factors are more important in attracting investment than membership or nonmembership of the euro.''
`pWe are heading to a new debate about a European Union with much larger internal differences.''
The distinctions seem likely to persist.
Analysts here said the Swedish vote might encourage euroskeptics in Denmark, which rejected euro membership three years ago.
``This was an anti-establishment cry,'' said Goran Rosenberg, a leading Swedish columnist.
``This was a sign or a warning, and not just for Sweden.''
"They have their weak points and they have their strong points, and life is difficult for all of them," said the president of the bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, at a news conference here.
"It wouldn't be in the interest of these countries to be in the euro zone right now," said Katinka Barysch, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London.
Public and private comments by central bankers and other officials here have been noticeably more relaxed since the beginning of January, when the dollar reversed its relentless decline against the euro -- even though economists caution that underlying trends have not changed.
"What central bankers really hate is a very quick appreciation in their currency," said Jorg Kramer, a senior economist at the HVB Group in Munich.
"I'm not sure anymore whether the euro-dollar rate is such an enormous hurdle, especially for German industry," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London.
Trichet, among other officials, said he took Snow's remarks very seriously.
In this hilly corner of Bohemia -- so bitterly fought over when it was called the Sudetenland before World War II -- European integration has done better in guaranteeing peace than prosperity.
"That debate is going to become a lot sharper over the next few months."
Gros said that if the Italian government did not arrest the slide, it could lose a decade's worth of work in preparing itself to adopt the euro.
"This alienation between Europe and its public must be overcome, and therefore in my opinion, we need an honest debate about Turkish membership," Merkel told supporters in Berlin.
Berlusconi did not endorse the idea, but neither did he denounce it.
But different budget allocations may have resulted in a stronger safety organization, with members present at all the right meetings.
A. I think your editors were asking if NASA, as structured today, is capable of operating the program we've got and, in particular, an aging space shuttle fleet.
"I don't think we thought a year ago that it would take so long to get the shuttle ready for flight."
"In a company, changing culture is essentially about leadership."
"Space flight is risky," Griffin said.
For the shuttle, he said, "this is the beginning of the end."
" He works alongside engineers whom he battled with during the Columbia mission, he said, and "we have a congenial working relationship."
Do I think the system has changed enough? No."
``My own view would be to let him bluster, let him rant and rave all he wants and let that be a matter between he and his own country,'' Armey said in response to a reporter's question.
``As long as he behaves himself within his own borders, we should not be addressing any attack or resources against him.''
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Saddam's speech did not alter Bush's view of Iraq.
The White House had little reaction to Armey's comments.
``He has a right to hold dominion within his own national boundaries, as obnoxious as he is and as comical as he can be,'' said Armey.
``There are very few Americans who believe Saddam Hussein is not a threat and should stay in power.
US officials described the demonstrations as a new freedom of expression for Iraqis that was not allowed under Saddam Hussein.
``The United States of America does not want to run Iraq,'' Chalabi said.
Americans were made to believe we could defuse the most dangerous nation on earth in a bargain-basement rout.
Dobbs said anti-war campaigners are focusing on Congress in an attempt to end funding for the war.

A World Health Organization team seeking to clarify the situation in Beijing has visited a few hospitals and pored over records, making what team members described as slow, steady progress.
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta don't completely discount the e&amp;feBtiveness of herbal preventative medicine, but say there haven't been enough studies to draw conclusions.
``If the body is strong your immune system is strong,'' says Muy Ear, who works at a Chinatown herb shop called Hing Fat Co.
``If you're strong and healthy, you don't have to worry about this SARS.''
Dr.Barry R. Bloom, the dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, said choosing a specific incubation period is ``arbitrary for an agent that we don't know much about.''
But there is ``not a specific day when all hat is likely to detect the most severe cases yet could miss milder ones.
In the hills southwest of Beijing, authorities haven't shown much interest in SARS prevention.
Stringent precautions are a key feature in controlling any future spread of SARS, two teams of researchers said in the papers published Friday.
The second group, from England and Hong Kong, argued that such efforts have already proven their usefulness, by reducing the once-explosive spread of SARS in Hong Kong to the current trickle of several cases a day.
``SARS is probably here to stay,'' said spokesman Llelwyn Grant of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
President Bush called the blackout ``a wake-up call'' to modernize the nation's power-sharing system.
``But it wasn't too bad.''
Other power industry officials said there were some signs that the trouble might have started in Michigan.
Energy officials called the situation tenuous and said it was critical for people to conserve electricity to avoid rolling blackouts.
Michael Holstein, vice president and chief financial officer at the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, which helps manage electrical flows on the grid for certain companies in the region where the blackout began, called the Cambridge Energy scenario ``an interesting hypothesis.''
Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, said events also moved too quickly for humans to react and keep the state from going dark.
``It is likely that the automated controls tripped some transmission lines moments before they would have burned down because of extremely high power flows out of our system,'' said Henry Fayne, American Electric's executive vice president for energy delivery.
At that point, Stauffer said, a blackout was inevitable.
Opponents say those lines have become increasingly overloaded as more companies use them to transmit more power over longer distances.
Many observers of the electricity industry, however, either question or dispute the notion that this month's problems can be attributed to deregulation.
``To say it was due to deregulation or not at this point is premature,'' said Ellen Raines, a spokeswoman for FirstEnergy Corp., an Ohio company that owned or partly owned transmission lines that went out of service just before the blackout.
He said deregulation is ``one of many factors that may have contributed'' to the problem.
Even Brian McCarthy, deregulation coordinator for the utility workers union and a passionate critic of deregulation, stopped short of predicting that the blackout will ultimately be attributed to a failure to invest in infrastructure improvements as a direct result of deregulation.
Companies might have invested more in transmission improvements if they believed they could profit from them without having to abide by government rules that restrict what they can recoup from spending on transmission, said Jonathan Adler, an assistant law professor at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in environmental and regulatory law.
But he said Ohio's deregulation law did play a role in discouraging Ohio utilities from investing in the power grid because it imposed a five-year rate freeze on FirstEnergy and other power companies.
``Other countries that supported Bush, like Italy and Poland, could be next in line.''
While the general public in Europe may not have felt at direct risk before the Mqtridic opinion will catch up with government and expert opinion in having a realistic appraisal of the extent to which Islamic Jihadists pose a threat to Europe,'' said Gary Samore, a terrorism expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
He said that Germans should not feel exempt from terrorism because their government opposed the war in Iraq; the Germans do station troops in Afghanistan, for instance.
``If al-Qaida had the opportunity to blow up a train in Berlin,'' he asked, ``why would they hesitate?''
He describes the ease of buying false documents but stresses quality, saying, "If you don't know who used them, it is dangerous."
"With all he's got going for him, it's hard to believe Kerry is stumbling so badly here," said William P. Blair III, a Canton lawyer and lobbyist, a former Democrat and nominal Republican who now describes himself as an independent of sorts.
"I understand the need to put it behind him, given the math," said Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore's 2000 campaign for president.
"It's a tragedy but it is also an opportunity to demonstrate that terrorism doesn't drive out everything else," said Morton Abramowitz, who served as American ambassador to Thailand a quarter century ago and went on to become a co-founder of the International Crisis Group, which helps prepare governments to respond to unexpected shocks.
"I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help."

If Kyoto goes into force, foreign rather than U.S. companies making everything from wind energy to thermal windows will benefit from its provisions, said Jonathan Pershing of the World Resources Institute.
Pershing, a former deputy director of the State Department Office of Global Change who helped negotiate the treaty, said domestic producers in countries that are reducing greenhouse gases under the treaty will be favored over U.S. competitors.
"If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set," Blair said, "it must be part of their agenda, too."
There are many problems facing the world that are far more pressing than global warming: 5 million children in poverty, an AIDS/HIV crisis that is devastating sub-Saharan Africa, and the resurgence of vector-borne diseases like malaria (malariologists agree that global warming is not an important factor in their resurgence).
Our children will not thank us for stepping out down a road we know will lead to ruin, when the road to prosperity is well-marked.
Nathan Mantua, assistant director of the Center for Science in the Earth System at the University of Washington, which estimates the impact of global warming on the Northwest, said the coalition's efforts were laudable, but probably of limited global impact.
"It may be an environmentally significant step for air quality in the cities that are going to do this, but for the global warming problem it is a baby step.
But it is unusual in its open embrace of an international agreement the Bush administration has spurned and significant, Nickels's office said, because cities are huge contributors to the nation's overall emission of heat-trapping gases.
Beijing tolerated -- some say helped organize -- the protests last weekend to underscore its diplomatic dispute with Japan over history textbooks, oil and gas reserves in the East China Sea, and Japan's bid to join the U.N. Security Council.
"Nationalism is a double-edged sword," said a leading campaigner for peasant rights and rural health care.
Another man, a 23-year-old barber in central Shanghai, where several shops catering to Japanese were destroyed, said he had nothing against Japan or Japanese people.
"It is all right to express anger against Japan," advised Wu Jinglian, an economist at a government research institute, "but some actions do not necessarily best achieve our goal."
Yet many analysts agree that screening the Internet and cell phones is far more difficult than the practice of simply ordering state-controlled newspapers or television stations to censor a subject.
"Similar to Madrid, this will turn out to be a homegrown terrorist group that has no other connection to the disparate group we in American call al-Qaida than ideology," Bearden said.
"Al-Qaida has franchised to the point where it's almost impossible to determine whether a group is al-Qaida or not," said Anthony Cordesman, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank based in Washington.
The United States and Europe need to address the root cause of terrorism, said Peter Bergen, a terror analyst and author of a book about bin Laden.
There is a false assumption that al-Qaida operates like a business, said Robert Friedmann, a professor of criminal justice at George State University and author of a recent book on terrorism.
"If you get rid of Osama bin Laden tomorrow, there will be 15 leaders who will take his place."
"Madrid carried terror to the heart of Europe, but we never believed we would be a lonely, unique case," said Jorge Dezcallar, who was the head of Spain's foreign intelligence service during the Madrid attacks, in a telephone interview.
"We just had the bad luck of being chosen as the first target, but not the last.
He added, "That is always the logic of terrorism, to get the maximum attention and impact."
Counterterrorism officials had said they were worried that the prime target was the 122-year-old Underground, the world's busiest subway system, which ferries 3 million people each day.
"But we believe that the guy is worth more than what little he has been telling us."
A senior European intelligence official, who was briefed by Scotland Yard, said that "the British believe that the cell has been in the U.K. for some time, assimilating with the society."
"The attacks in London do not change the general threat we face here in the U.S." Bald said.
"What develops from the investigation of the London attacks could shed light on the threat situation in the U.S."
"This is what everyone has feared," Ranstorp said.
"Probably before long I will have forgotten about it.
It sounds dreadful but you just get on with life."
"I argue that it is a fundamental civil liberty of people in Europe to be able to go to work on their transport system in the morning without being blown up or subjected to terrorist attack or to conduct their lives without being at risk of serious and organized crime," he said.
"The question of civil liberties has to be treated in a proportionate way."
"The individual acts carried out by people in the name of resistance may or may not be heroic," he said.
But we'd like to suggest that Brown's departing statement is only half right.
Although some have warned for years of the doom that avian flu could wreak, the virus is getting new attention.
Experts are watching the avian flu, or bird flu, with heightened concern.
There are both frightening and promising implications in this week's announcement that research teams have deciphered the genetic sequence of the devastating 1918 influenza virus and have synthesized the lethal germ in a high-security laboratory.
"One of our major concerns is now the potential spread of avian influenza through migratory birds to North and Eastern Africa," said Dr. Joseph Domenech, the chief veterinary officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, which monitors the spread of the disease in animals.
"In birds, this is a disease of biblical proportions and it is difficult to control in a setting where people depend on poultry as a major source of protein for growing children," said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of surveillance and response at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
As bird flu has jumped this year from Southeast Asia to China, Russia, Kazakhstan and -- more recently -- into the Balkan region of Europe, scientists have become somewhat belatedly convinced that wild migratory birds are one of the main carriers of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
"In birds this is a disease of biblical proportions, and it is difficult to control in a setting where people depend on poultry as a major source of protein for growing children," said Dr. Mike Ryan, Director of surveillance and response at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
Poor farmers may chose not to report deaths for fear of losing their birds.
"There are probably lots of people there who were exposed and got sick for a couple of days and fought it off."
? "Once there is better surveillance of populations surrounding the cases we know about, people will find the death rate is a lot less than 50 percent," he predicted.
"There is this dance between viral evolution and human activity and history and technology," said Dr.David Ozonoff, an environmental health specialist at the Boston University School of Public Health.
"An urgency" exists to do more research to determine the most effective anti-viral treatment for any strain that might mutate to cause a human pandemic of influenza, said an influenza expert at the World Health Organization.
Scientists have predicted that the A (H5N1) strain would become resistant to Tamiflu in an unknown percentage of cases.

"I think we must do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat, and to implement safety measures," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters.
"We had never expected such rapid corrosion."
"We must put all our effort into determining the cause of the accident and to ensuring safety," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said.
"We have to pay close attention so that our lives won't be affected by this accident."
The Yomiuri, a conservative newspaper, warned: "Care must be taken not to overemphasize the dangers involved in the operation of nuclear power stations, which could lead to an overreaction.
Operations at other nuclear power plants must not be undermined."
Habermeyer added that the Crystal River site, while attractive, also has some disadvantages.
But he added that he hopes local residents and public officials will recognize what he said are the environmental and economic advantages of nuclear power as well.
Jia suggested that China was willing to hold talks with Chen, albeit on terms he had rejected in the past.
"We have no bias against whom we negotiate with, and are not unwilling to talk just because someone is in power," Jia said in a speech later broadcast on national television.
"From the perspective of an ordinary person, and as a businessman, I hope the governments of both sides can create a good environment in the future and get this going," Lin said.
