EUROPE'S SLOWING ECONOMIES
Why are the euro-area economies so weak, and Germany's in particular?
The opposite has happened.
Interest rates are currently higher than if monetary policy had been set according to conditions in Germany alone.
As a result, Germany's economy has been squeezed.
Germany's GDP grew at an annual rate of only 1.1 percent in the second quarter of this year, leaving it just 0.1 percent higher than a year ago.
Italy's economy also grew by a paltry 0.9 percent in the second quarter, but the other two big economies, France and Spain, are expected to show stronger growth.
Even so, a recent slide in business confidence has caused many economists to trim their forecast for growth in the euro area in 2002, to around 1 percent.
By contrast, the United States is still tipped to grow by over 2 percent.
So why does the ECB not cut its interest rate, currently at 3.25 percent, compared with America's rate of 1.75 percent?
The headline rate for the whole euro area, at 1.9 percent, is a whisker below the 2 percent ceiling of the ECB's target, but core inflation, excluding food and energy, is 2.5 percent.
Most economists do not expect rates to be cut this year.
This raises two questions.
First, are rates currently appropriate for the euro area as a whole?
Second, how much lower would they be if the Bundesbank was still setting interest rates to suit Germany alone?
The closer inflation is to zero, the harder it is to get the negative real interest rates often necessary in a recession, since nominal rates cannot go below zero.
Research by the International Monetary Fund suggests that, if average inflation targets are set below 2 percent, then there is a marked increase in the risk that interest rates will hit zero and that deflation may occur.
It might therefore be safer if the ECB aimed for a higher inflation target, with a midpoint (not a ceiling) of 2 percent to 2.5 percent.
In which case, interest rates ought now to be lower.
Its inflation rate is only 1 percent.
And, thanks to weaker growth, the country's output gap (actual GDP less trend GDP) is estimated at minus 3 percent, twice as large as in the rest of the euro area.
A way to gauge the appropriate level of interest rates in Germany is to consult the Taylor rule, devised by John Taylor, currently at America's Treasury Department.
This calculates the ``correct'' interest rate according to the inflation rate and the size of the output gap.
It suggests that the German interest rate should now be a full percentage point lower than that set for the euro area as a whole.
In theory, if a country cannot cut interest rates, because of monetary union, it should use fiscal policy to support its economy.
Yet Europe's stability and growth pact does not allow euro-area governments to borrow more than 3 percent of GDP.
On current policies, Germany's budget deficit may breach 3 percent of GDP this year.
Under the stability pact's rules, that would force the government to tighten policy, further depressing its economy.
Yet net exports from the euro area have increased over the past year.
It has been weak domestic demand, not external demand, that has dragged down economies.
In Germany, exports have been the only source of growth: consumer spending and investment have fallen over the past year.
Even if weak export markets cannot be blamed, the bursting of America's economic bubble has squeezed spending in other ways _ through foreign investment, share prices and business confidence.
Following a wave of acquisitions in the 1990s, European firms' dollar sales from their American subsidiaries are now four times bigger than their exports to America.
America's slump has therefore squeezed parent firms' profits in Europe, forcing them to cut investment back home.
European share prices have also tracked Wall Street more closely than usual _ or have fallen further.
German equities have fallen by 52 percent from their peak in 2000.
This is more than in other European markets and more than the 40 percent fall in America's S&amp;P 500 index.
Only one-fifth of Germans own shares, compared with half of Americans, so the direct wealth effect is smaller.
The indirect effect, through confidence, could be disproportionately large.
In recent years the correlation between indicators of business confidence in America and in the euro area has increased.
The mood of European businessmen seems to follow the mood swings of American bosses a few months later.
The correlation is closest for Germany, where businesses are most exposed to the American market, after buying lots of companies there.
Do European economies have financial imbalances akin to America's?
Household saving rates are much higher and the euro area has a current-account surplus, in contrast to America's big deficit.
The total debts of nonfinancial companies in the euro area have climbed, from 47 percent of GDP in 1997 to 58 percent at the end of 2001.
The debts of American companies also rose sharply, yet are still lower, at under 50 percent of GDP.
Total household debt as a share of GDP is also higher in Germany than in the United States.
Slow growth, very low inflation and high debts are a painful combination.
Corporate bankruptcies in Germany are running at three times their level in the early 1990s; in France they are half their level of a decade ago.
But, unlike companies in America, German ones have no monetary guardian to rescue them by cutting interest rates.
The risk of a double-dip recession, and perhaps even of deflation, might therefore be higher in Germany than it is in the United States.

FOR NOW, BRITAIN KEEPS ITS DISTANCE FROM THE EURO
When Britons finally decide whether or not to join the European single currency _ whenever that may be _ they will ultimately be making a political choice about where they belong: in Europe or someplace on its fringes.
On Monday, Chancellor Gordon Brown is expected to announce to Parliament that Britain will, for now, remain on the fringes.
The political choice will be cloaked in an economic mantle: Brown has devised five tests to discover whether Britain needs the euro, and will cast his decision in terms of whether British jobs and incomes would benefit from finally saying farewell to the pound.
Brown is widely seen as far more skeptical about the euro than Prime Minister Tony Blair, and most analysts expect the chancellor to say the tests have not been met, and therefore there is no need for a referendum on the euro.
Most euro watchers say the key issue will simply be whether Brown will bow to the wishes of Blair and leave open the door to a further review of the economic tests before the next election, which must be held by 2006.
But beyond those arguments, there is an array of economic f!ctNrs that offer both sides ammunition to argue the case for and against the five tests of whether the British and Continental economies are converging to Britain's advantage.
Take, for i.stnce, a decision on Thursday by the Bank of England to leave Britain's interest rates unchanged at 3.75 percent while the European Central B  That, said anti-euro campaigners, proved that Britain and the euro zone were out of step with one another because the Continental Europeans needed to spur economic growth, while Britain's economy was already growing.
Britons traditionally try to buy their houses, and interest rates on mortgages are important to voters.
A central argument invoked against the euro is that Britain would no longer be able to control the levers of its economy if interest rates were decreed by the European Central Bank.
In the past, for instance, British exports suffered because the pound was too strong against the euro, making British goods expensive for Continental Europeans to buy.
Apart from Britain, the only European Union members outside the euro zone are Denmark and Sweden.
The pound's future is intimately entwined with an emotional nationalistic debate over sovereignty and suspicion of Europe that suffuses the anti-euro campaign.
But there are clear economic differences as well.
While Britain's economy is still believed likely to grow, the German economy at the heart of the euro zone is stagnating.
British unemployment is at record lows while it is high in many of the leading euro-zone economies.
A further issue to be assessed by Brown on Monday is whether foreign investment in Britain by big international companies seeking a European base, like the automakers Nissan and Toyota, will be withdrawn if Britain gives no indication that it plans to join the euro.
A recent report by Ernst &amp; Young, the consulting firm, found that foreign companies are increasingly investing in countries outside the European Union, including the 10 Eastern and Central European countries that are set to join next year.
AFTER SWEDISH VOTE, QUESTIONS ABOUT EUROPE'S FUTURE
One day after Swedish voters ruled out the likelihood for years to come of adopting the euro single currency, Europe's great project to bond itr `isparate players into a single force to rival the United States seemed doubtful.
The Swedish referendum rejecting euro membership by a staggering 14 percentage points not only bolstered euroskeptics in the other holdout states _ Britain and Denmark _ but it also reinforced the possibility that, far from being one, Europe could soon be perceived as falling into three castes.
The first, led by France and Germany _ architects of the single currency, designed to shield against the wars that stud the Continent's history _ would embrace primarily the 12 nations using the single currency.
This faction is distinguished as much by its inability to inspire economic growth as by its refusal to support the United States in Iraq.
The second, in terms of economic and political power, would be a loose alliance of eurozone hold-outs, while the third would be drawn from the 10 countries, largely from the former Soviet empire, expected to gain their long-coveted European Union membership next year.
Those nations are committed to joining the euro but must first make wrenching economic adjustments.
Within the 15-nation body, national agendas are nothing new.
Britain, for example, seeks prominence in efforts to build European military cooperation, but remains aloof from both the euro and agreements that have opened borders across much of Continental Europe.
But the Swedish vote, some analysts suggested, may have taken that process a step further by enshrining the idea that individual exceptions outweigh commitments to the pan-European ideal.
Technically, for instance, Sweden had already agreed to accept the euro in a 1994 referendum on joining the European Union.
``If Great Britain wants to be Atlantic, and Poland prefers Washington to Brussels and if Spain believes just as strongly in hispanidad as it doe{0Gud a coin are enough to create a European patriotism.''
Swedish leaders said it could be 10 years before they seek euro entry again while euroskeptics in Britain argue that, as Janet Bush, an anti-euro campaigner, put it, ``it is now highly unlikely that British public opinion will be moved on the euro for many years to come.''
In some ways, the outcome showed how hard-headed and relatively prosperous Swedes had come to view the eurozone recession.
They looked askance at France's and Germany's failure to adhere to the euro's internal rules as they tackled deficits.
For all that, it seems unlikely that the Swedish vote will galvanize the big eurozone countries into changing policy.
''I view it as a wake-up call, though I'm afraid they won't hear it,'' said Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies in Paris.
The vote seemed as significant for its repercussions outside Sweden as for its consequences within.
Euroskeptics in Britain seized on the vote to underline their position.
Prime Minister Tony's Blair's government, in a credibility crisis over Iraq, had already postponed a pro-euro ``road show'' planned for this summer.
Blair's spokesman repeated on Monday that British membership depended on arriving at a ``clear and unambiguous'' assessment that it would be in Britain's economic interest to join.
But the prospect of a referendum before the next election, expected by 2006 at the latest, seems remote.
The vote may also prove a setback for politicians in neighboring Norway who are trying to nudge the country toward joining the European Union.
But some say the Swedish vote reflected the emotions of a country whose people feel remote from ruling elites and who sense that the European project negates their democratic aspirations.
EUROPE'S NEW MEMBERS NOT READY FOR THE EURO
Six months after the European Union admitted 10 new members, capping their journey from communism to the free market, they got a blunt reminder that the club's inner sanctum, its currency union, will remain off limits to them for several more years.
The European Central Bank said in a report issued Wednesday that fewer than half the new members had met the fiscal requirements to adopt the euro.
None had met the political requirements, according to a companion report issued by the European Commission.
Trichet said there was no timetable for countries to adopt the euro, echoing what is by now the conventional wisdom here: with the exception of Estonia and one or two of its Baltic neighbors, none of these countries will be ready for the euro until the end of the decade.
That is a remarkable turnabout from the heady days just before the expansion of the European Union, when political leaders in Budapest, Prague, Warsaw and Bratislava talked about adopting the euro in short order.
Now, in Prague, the finance ministry and the central bank are squabbling about whether the Czech Republic can meet even the less ambitious deadline of 2010.
The reason for much of the backsliding, experts say, is the political upheaval that erupted in many countries after they entered the union.
The collapse of coalition governments and a revolving door of prime ministers has scrambled fiscal policies and raised doubts about the independence of their central banks.
"That is the normal process in a democracy."
In some countries, the political tumult is taking on a less-than-democratic flavor.
Hungary's newly elected prime minister, Ferenc Gyurcsany, is pushing legislation in Parliament that would allow him to appoint half the members of the governing board of the central bank.
The new law, if approved, could tilt the board in favor of the prime minister.
Its budget deficit is equal to 5.5 percent of gross domestic product -- well above the 3 percent cap mandated by Brussels.
The Czech Republic has also struggled to stem a tide of red ink.
Its deficit peaked at 12.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2003, before falling to an estimated 5 percent this year.
That volatility prompted the deputy governor of the Czech central bank, Ludek Niedermayer, to question whether the country will achieve its goal of reducing the deficit to below 3 percent by 2008.
"They're under pressure because of the labor market," he said.
There are a few success stories.
It already pegs its currency to the euro, and could probably adopt the currency without disruption, analysts say.
But critics say that Europe's demand for fiscal discipline is ringing hollow at a time when 5 of the 12 euro countries -- including the two largest, Germany and France -- are in violation of the deficit rules.
Trichet said the situation led to an obvious question regarding the deteriorating fiscal situation of the would-be members: If Germany and France do not abide by the rules, why should other countries?
Still, the new countries have shown little sign of trying to use the Germans and the French as an alibi for their own fiscal problems.
Analysts say these countries recognize that they have to meet the requirements to get into the club before they can question the club's rules.
The bigger issue, some experts said, is that the race to adopt the euro has become less urgent for most countries.
They are struggling with thorny problems, like chronic unemployment, inflation and bankrupt pension systems amid an aging population, which a new currency will not solve.
"It's not their main priority."
EUROPE ASKS, WHAT EURO CRISIS?
Europeans, many of whom worked themselves into a tizzy about the swooning dollar and the stampeding euro last year, suddenly seem to have mellowed, as the dollar has rebounded in recent weeks.
The European Central Bank on Thursday left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent, and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, delivered a more sanguine message about growth prospects and inflation.
"The environment has changed a little," Trichet said at a news conference in Frankfurt.
He noted that the recent decline in oil prices had eased inflationary pressure and removed another hurdle to growth.
"While short-term inflationary pressures persist, they have recently diminished somewhat," Trichet declared.
He added, "The conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed."
The European Central Bank has tried to avoid being buffeted by the daily swings in the currency markets, resisting pressure last month to reduce interest rates, as the euro set daily records against the dollar.
But his otherwise relaxed tone suggested that for now, the euro was a manageable problem.
"The speed of the euro's appreciation has come down somewhat, so they are a bit more relaxed."
Kramer and other economists warn that the dollar's rebound is probably a technical correction rather than a lasting shift.
Most expect the euro to resume its upward course against the dollar, especially since the United States reported a record trade deficit and Asian countries, notably China, show few signs of letting their currencies appreciate against the dollar.
But even at an exchange rate of $1.36, which the euro reached on Dec. 30, most economists say the pressure on European exporters is bearable (on Thursday, the euro declined slightly, to $1.3203).
Germany reported on Thursday that its exports grew 8.2 percent last year, which drove the economy to a growth rate of 1.1 percent in 2004.
While the strong euro cut into exports to the United States, Germany was able to offset that with robust shipments to other European countries and Asia.
Italy and Spain, which have not undergone such a process, are feeling the effects of the currency on their exports more acutely.
For the first time in years, economists are starting to speak of Germany as a potential engine of growth for Europe, rather than a dragging anchor.
Retail sales picked up here over the Christmas holiday, and surveys of German business confidence turned up sharply in December.
The recovery of the dollar has also shifted many Europeans' gaze from the United States to Asia.
While last month European leaders were calling on the United States to tackle its trade and budget deficits, they are now calling on the Asians to allow their currencies to rise.
"There is a need for emerging Asia to go progressively in the direction of perhaps progressive and orderly appreciation," Trichet said, echoing comments made by the central bank's chief economist, Otmar Issing.
The change in tone, economists say, is also a response to recent comments by the American treasury secretary, John W.Snow, about the need to reduce the budget deficit in the United States.
There is still plenty of skepticism here about the readiness of the United States to confront the deficit or stanch the fall of the dollar, especially since a weak dollar benefits American exporters.
But after months of frustration, some here are choosing to look on the bright side.
"Europe has worried so much about the fiscal situation in the United States, much more than anyone in the U.S. worries about it," said Holger Schmieding, a European economist at Bank of America in London.
"This is one area where sentiment is changing a bit."
"My business is down 60 percent," said Rene Michl, a souvenir shop owner, as he peered out from a back room with tousled hair and an unshaven face that suggests he rarely needs to rouse himself for customers.
"The Germans don't come here anymore because it is too expensive."
Since last May 1, when the Czech Republic became a member state, its currency, the koruna, has risen 8 percent against the euro.
This makes Czech goods and services less of a bargain for Germans, who also come for mundane pursuits like grocery shopping and haircuts.
The Czech government has said it would like to make the switch around the turn of the decade.
"We saw what happened when it came to Germany," he said, noting how prices there went up.
Michl, 38, said he would soon have to close his shop.
Staring gloomily at his unsold jars of marmalade and bottles of Slivovitz, he talked of moving to Pilsen, a nearby industrial city, to look for work.
Jindrich Gonda, a 73-year-old retired electrician, supplements his pension by peddling Czech honey and handicrafts from a stall in the shadow of Zelezna Ruda's onion-domed church.
"Then everything changed in 1990, and, since then, we've looked only to the West.
Such tales of woe are still the exception in the Czech Republic, where the broader economy is growing briskly.
Long billed as a privilege of membership in Europe's club, the euro has lost much of its appeal here.
Part of the problem is psychology.
As a condition of entry into the union, the Czech Republic is obligated to adopt the euro someday, and with a strong euro in their pockets, one would think the Czech Republic would be a bargain for Germans, much as the United States is.
The trouble is, the koruna has more than held its own against the euro.
Rita Baumgaertner, a 52-year-old Bavarian who has made weekend trips to the Czech Republic for years, was rooting halfheartedly through a pile of clothes at an outdoor stall.
"I haven't found much this time," she said.
Poland's currency, the zloty, has experienced a similar rocket ride against the euro, hurting merchants who sell garden gnomes and other gewgaws in the Polish border towns near Germany.
In one way, Central Europe's rising currencies are a sign of vitality -- evidence of its climb from developing to developed status after its wrenching passage from communism to the free market.
That some people would be dislocated in the process is natural.
But that does not take the sting out of it.
Nowadays, the German cars are few and far between.
Sauer says he now gets just two or three German customers a month.
While he, too, blames the euro, he admits that competition also played a part.
His shop, which he took over from the local government in 1992, was once the only one in town; today, there are half a dozen.
The loss of the border trade is falling heaviest on Vietnamese immigrants, who trickled into the Czech Republic from East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and now run many of the souvenir stalls.
On a lonely bend in the road not far from Klatovy, Nguyen Thi Nu stood watch outside her stall -- alone, but for the dwarfs, Santa statues, and other garden gnomes lined up beside her.
"During the days of the D-mark," she said, "the German cars used to be lined up in the parking lot."
Nguyen, 45, has run the stall for eight years.
She lives behind it in a rattletrap trailer.
"I wouldn't know where else to go," she said.
FRENCH REJECTION OF EU CHARTER COULD TROUBLE EURO
While France's rejection of the proposed European Union constitution was a stinging rebuke to its own leaders, it could have painful consequences for economic integration in Europe and for the most tangible symbol of that unity: the euro.
By throwing Europe's political future into disarray, analysts said the vote could undermine the currency's stability -- not this week or next, but down the road, as it seeks to expand to more countries.
The euro wobbled in trading on Monday, hitting a seven-month low of $1.246 to the dollar.
It has fallen steadily against the dollar in recent weeks, as traders expected a negative vote in France, and steeled themselves for another rejection in the Netherlands on Wednesday.
Few experts are predicting a full-blown crisis for the euro, which is safeguarded by the politically independent European Central Bank.
France's refusal to ratify the constitution will have little impact on the day-to-day running of the monetary union, or on the maze of regulations that govern the world's largest trading bloc.
Still, as Paul De Grauwe, a Belgian expert on the currency, put it, "Something psychological has changed."
Like many economists, he believes that the long-term viability of the euro hinges on the gradual political integration of the countries that use it -- a prospect that, for now at least, is dashed.
"Can the euro survive without a political union?" De Grauwe said.
The French rejection also has troubling implications for Europe's economic future.
Spooked by a sullen, rebellious electorate, European leaders might give up trying to force sweeping changes of their social welfare systems.
"There has been a parallel debate in Germany and France about neo-liberalism versus the social market economy," said Allan Saunderson, chairman of EuroZone Advisers, a consulting firm in Frankfurt.
At its heart, he said, the question is whether these countries can still afford to prop up costly welfare states in a global economy.
In Germany, the debate has mutated into an occasionally vitriolic attack by the governing Social Democratic Party on big companies and foreign investors.
That trend is already visible in the European Commission's inability to enforce fiscal discipline among the 12 countries that use the euro.
Analysts say the French vote will further vitiate the Stability and Growth Pact, the agreement that limits deficits within the euro zone.
France, Germany, Italy and Portugal are all in violation of the deficit limits.
In Portugal, the deficit may reach 6.8 percent of gross domestic product this year -- more than twice the level allowed by Brussels.
Italy, with its mushrooming public debt, recession and declining competitive position, is of particular concern to economists.
Some Western European leaders are likely to resist the entry of Turkey into the union because it would stir voters' fears of an influx of low-cost foreign workers.
Fear of such cheap labor fueled the anti-Europe camp in France.
In Germany as in France, voters used a vote -- in this case a state election in North Rhine-Westphalia on May 22 -- to send a message to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder that his reform policies were not working.
Germany's jobless rate, at 11.8 percent, is a record in the post-World War II period.
Schroeder responded to his party's trouncing by moving up Germany's federal elections by a year, to September.
Angela Merkel, the conservative leader who was confirmed on Monday as the opposition's candidate for chancellor, took pains to play down her reputation as a radical reformer.
Merkel said her policies would be focused on finding "ways of creating work for people in Germany."
Some economists argue that Germany has progressed further in its reform process than either France or Italy.
By keeping a lid on wage increases, German companies have managed to regain their competitiveness.
German exports continue to thrive, even as the domestic economy falters.
"Germany is about to diverge," Gros said.
"If they elect a new government, they can say, 'we're the solid anchor of Europe."'
Some argue that Europe's anchor is no longer any one country, but its single currency.
Saunderson described the euro as a "port in the political storm," adding that the European Central Bank has so far been immune from pressures to lower interest rates to prop up faltering economies.
European markets, led by shares of exporters like Porsche of Germany and Royal Phillips Electronics of the Netherlands, rose on Monday.
Still, currency analysts took a more jaundiced view, saying the euro's fall could quicken if the Netherlands followed France in its rejection of the constitution.
"This could lead central banks to rethink their policy, and slow down the accumulation of euros."
DOES THE EURO HAVE A FUTURE?
Is the euro in danger of dying before it reaches its seventh birthday?
But the fact that they were discussing the issue at all highlighted the notion that Europe's common currency is taking part of the blame for the Continent's economic woes.
Few, if any, think the euro will stop being the legal currency of much of Europe.
But after French and Dutch voters stunned the political establishment by rejecting the proposed European constitution, those opposed to other European institutions have been emboldened.
"It is just inconceivable that a country could envisage dropping out of the euro," said Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg premier and current president of the European Union.
Hans Eichel, the German finance minister, said the very idea of a country withdrawing was "nonsense," and Pedro Solbes, the Spanish economy minister, called the common currency "irreversible."
The row was started when two Italian Cabinet ministers from the Northern League, which is tenuously allied with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, suggested a referendum on returning to the lira.
Nostalgia for national currencies has risen in the last year as European unemployment has remained stubbornly high and growth has trailed that of the United States and Asia.
The magazine said the margin of error was 3 percentage points.
On one level, the euro has been a great success.
Travel among the 12 countries that use it is far easier, and companies in those countries can contract with others knowing there is no currency risk involved.
The euro was officially created at the beginning of 1999, but actual euro coins and bills did not become legal currency until the beginning of 2002.
But economic integration of the euro zone has not come as rapidly as some had hoped and that has created stresses.
"You cannot succeed over any length of time with one monetary policy and 12 fiscal policies," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG Inc.
THE END OF THE EURO?
The key question is, will the euro expire as well?
Certainly there's been no small amount of hand-wringing over the defeats the EU suffered this month.
How did it happen?
The French answer relates to Charles de Gaulle's famous question: How can you govern a country that has 246 kinds of cheese?
Economically, culturally, intellectually, France is beset by deep protectionist, antiglobalization instincts.
Its electorate is a collection of fractious constituencies that have carved out special arrangements for themselves and are fierce in the protection of those uncompetitive deals.
Similarly powerful forces may also come to imperil the euro.
It reduces the hassle of business transactions, introduces predictability, eliminates the need for the endless hedging that once occupied legions of currency traders, and promotes capital formation.
For travelers, a single currency obviously eases trips between the various countries of the euro zone.
And despite early worries that the euro couldn't compete with the dollar, as the United States has slid from the balanced budgets and surpluses of the late 1990s to an era of deficits and borrow-and-spend economics, Europe's unified currency has fared rather well, perhaps too well.
But those benefits have come at a cost.
The pact that allows for a single currency also hobbles the members of Euroland by restricting their monetary and fiscal policies.
Rationalizing those policies has required more discipline than some participating countries would likely have been able to muster on their own, given their domestic political situations.
Indeed, the European Central Bank has retained some of the character of Germany's Bundesbank, which used to be the de facto interest-rate-setting institution for much of Western Europe.
That is, it is inflation-averse and favors a relatively strong currency.
But with the continental economy sluggish, countries like Italy want the cheaper money and lower interest rates that would promote economic expansion.
Under the euro, however, they have lost control over the currency they use - which means they can't devalue their way back to competitiveness - as well as the interest rates they pay.
Fiscal policy is similarly constrained.
One Keynesian remedy long applied to laggardly economies is deficit spending.
By adding the demand of new spending to the economy, a government can create a pump-priming burst of economic activity.
To be part of Euroland, however, members have to keep any budget deficit within 3 percent of GDP, which obviously reduces their ability to spend their way out of recession.
A further source of friction: While countries like Ireland, Finland, Belgium, and Austria have taken that rule seriously, Euroland's two pillars have not.
When their own economies have hit tough times, France and Germany have flouted the budgetary requirements and gotten away with it.
With the EU process stalled, the subterranean tensions besetting the currency are now coming to the surface - and at a time when some of the continent's biggest Eurocrats have lost favor.
That's a shame, because in many ways, the loss of the unified currency, with its concrete commercial benefits, would spell a more serious blow to Europe than the failure of the EU's constitution.
Which is why, even as they discuss the possibility of salvaging the moribund constitution, EU officials should contemplate a related worry: how to ensure that the euro survives the populist backlash touched off by France and the Netherlands.

KICKING THE EURO WHEN EUROPE IS DOWN
Not so long ago, Italy's unlikely qualification for the euro was a source of national pride.
"It has caused devastating price increases for the average family, and made the small and medium-size companies that are the core of the Italian economy uncompetitive.
A return to the lira is technically possible, and we will pursue the possibility of a referendum on this issue."
The fact is, the long-term future of the euro is a central question posed by the European Union's recent upheaval.
The shared money that replaced national currencies in 2002 was always as much a political as an economic idea.
It symbolized the pursuit of a European political union.
Without such union, the French and German backers of the euro argued, the new money would be orphaned.
But with the French and Dutch rejection of a European constitution two weeks ago, momentum toward further political integration was lost.
The time of the orphans is upon Europe.
The European Union budget is in dispute, Europe's direction unclear.
A fundamental European conflict has taken hold between the French-German-Italian push for federation (embodied by the euro) and the British-Polish-Scandinavian stand for a Europe that is more free-trade area than cohesive political entity.
Because the more rigid economies of the former grouping are not as dynamic as those of the latter, Europe's unifying forces are faltering.
Even in the short term, Europe's lack of political coherence can cause economic problems in the euro zone.
The Italian economy is in recession.
Before the advent of the euro, Italy could always devalue the lira in order to spur growth by making its exports cheaper and, in that way, more attractive.
But that exchange-rate flexibility is now gone; Italy must compete on the same playing field as Germany.
The problem is that it is not selling high-tech machinery or superb automobiles.
Some of Italy's main export industries are in sectors like shoes, textiles and clothes that are particularly vulnerable to Chinese competition.
Because trade issues are handled at the European level, the Italian government has little room to maneuver.
The link between citizens, their representatives and executive action is more cumbersome in Europe than in the United States -- and that is a source of animosity toward Brussels eurocrats.
Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, has now negotiated some limits on Chinese textile imports, but the anger that feeds populist calls for a return of the lira will also persist.
"More than 80 percent of Italian companies have fewer than 15 employees.
They are suffering.
What he did not say is that Britain pulled off in the 1990s something Italy has avoided: the shift, which also occurred in the United States, to an economy with a strong service sector and less manufacturing.
"Our former growth was artificial, based on the lira's continued depreciation and accumulation of government debt," said Tommaso Monacelli, an economist.
"Of course, people get nostalgic.
With elections next year, Maroni's Northern League will continue to push the lira as a vote-getter.
Berlusconi will not openly encourage his allies in this, but he doesn't seem likely to express outrage: his four-party coalition needs all the support it can get.
A recession and an electoral campaign amount to a heady brew.
Anti-euro and anti-European slogans will be flying, even if the lira's return would sink Italy (the country's credibility would be shot and the costs of its debt servicing would soar).
But a time of hard choices has come.
Just how hard is suggested by the bust of Marco Biagi in the entrance to Maroni's ministry on the Via Veneto.
The leftist Red Brigades assassinated Biagi in 2002, three months after the euro's introduction, because he was an architect of measures to bring greater flexibility to uncompetitive Italian labor markets.
PAINFUL QUESTIONS FROM A FORMER ASTRONAUT
Ride, 52, enjoys going about life with a degree of anonymity.
After her flights in 1983 and 1984, Ride, at the time one of the most famous women on Earth, rejected most product endorsements, books and movie offers that came her way.
Instead, she was a co-author of several books for children on space and was on the 1986 presidential commission that investigated the Challenger space shuttle disaster.
With the conclusion of the Columbia inquiry, Ride, who is on leave as a professor of physics at the University of California at San Diego, is free to focus on her new mission, encouraging girls to become scientists.
Q. This past February, as we all watched pictures of the Columbia exploding, people asked, ``How could this possibly be happening again?'' Do you have any answers?
A. We have been asking ourselves the same question.
There are many parallels.
Not so much between the accidents themselves, but between some of the organizational contributing causes to the accidents.
One parallel is that before the Challenger accident there were several shuttle flights where the first stages of the problem were seen.
Q. Are there parallels between the Columbia problem and the famous O-rings, where rubber rings on the Challenger rocket boosters froze, leading to the explosion.
A. Yes, and it was recognized, dealt with in some way.
But they never spent the money to do the required engineering tests to understand exactly what was going on.
The problem occurred a second time, but Challenger got to orbit fine.
Gradually, over the course of several flights, the mindset became: ``We've seen this problem before.
It didn't cause a catastrophe.
It's probably OK.''
It was seen as something that should be fixed, eventually.
With Columbia, there was a history of foam coming off the external tank during launch.
Each time, it was identified as a problem.
But there was never a real significant engineering effort to understand why this was happening, what the potential implications were and what needed to be done to stop it.
There was no catastrophic damage the first time, the second time or even the third time.
It got to be accepted as almost, ``in the family.''
Q. What role did the NASA internal culture play in creating some of the conditions that made the two accidents possible?
A. It's another parallel.
Before the Challenger accident, engineers who wanted to postpone the shuttle launch were effectively, they felt, required to prove a safety problem.
Normally, it's just the reverse.
With Columbia, the foam strike was observed the day after the launch, and a group of engineers was tasked with accessing what damage could result.
Again, those engineers found themselves having to prove that there'd be catastrophic consequences in order to be listened to.
Normally, it would be just the opposite.
In order to get additional imagery of Columbia so they could determine the damage, they had to prove that there was a very, very serious problem.
Q. NASA never obtained additional photographs of Columbia's damaged area. .
The leader of its mission management team, Linda Ham, has said that once the foam strike was detected, some of her engineers wanted her to ask the Pentagon to take spy satellite pictures of the shuttle.
Because she could not track down who was urging that, she dropped the matter.
Was that an adequate response?
One of the responsibilities of a NASA manager is to be inquisitive to a fault.
You have to ask and ask and ask.
If you think there's any hint of a problem, you have to get to the bottom of it.
In my mind, the question was not, Who is asking this question?
What the managers needed to be asking is, What are the potential consequences of thbing onto the pants legs of a problem and not letting go until it understands what the problem is and what the implications are.
And that didn't happen in this case.
The managers, the Mission Management Team and the Mission Evaluation Room, did not grab onto this problem and insist on an answer.
It was really quite the opposite.
They assumed they knew the answer.
They assumed the foam was not going to be a problem.
Aod$they were insisting that people disprove the preconception they had.
Q. Since the accident, there has been much talk about the role budget cuts may have played in the tragedy.
What could a bigger budget have done about the kind of cultural problems of NASA's workplace that you have just cited?
If they had the tools, the trend analysis and the engineering analysis, they might have stood up in these meetings and offered checks and balances.
Partly because of funding and priorities, a checks and balances system didn't exist that could have mitigated the problem.
Q. Dan Goldin, the NASA administrator from 1992 to 2001, had a mantra, ``Faster, better, cheaper.''
Was that a mistake?
It's very difficult to have all three simultaneously.
Pick your favorite two.
And over the years, it provides the impression that budget and schedule are the most important things.
Q. The board investigated whether a rescue of the C/luLbia crew might have been feasible.
What's the point to that kind of second guessing?
A. Because as we started to investigate decision-making, we were getting a sense that NASA people were wondering:
``Why are you asking about this?
This doesn't have anything to do with the accident.''
We said, ``OK, let's study if a rescue or a repair might have been possible.''
NASA formed a team to look into it.
The scenario that we gave them included a series of events that led to the conclusion on Flight Day 5 that there was catastrophic damage to the wing.
Their study showed that it might have been possible to have gotten Atlantis to the launch pad by about Feb. 10 and to keep everyone on Columbia alive until the rescue team reached them.
A lot of things had to go right for that to work.
But the study proved it was feasible.
This same kind of study could have been done by NASA in time to do it during the mission.
Would you agree?
Counting the Apollo 1 fire, there have been three major NASA accidents, each of them almost a generation apart.
The problem is, people forget.
The lessons of Challenger, for instance, were on everyone's minds at NASA flot of things crept into the system without people's noticing.
The other thing is, You've got to have the perspective that space flight is really risky.
Choose your favorite rocket.
If it's really good, it fails two out of 100 times.
If it's not quite as good, it fails four out of 100 times.
The shuttle launched successfully 112 times and failed twice.
I flew the shuttle twice.
It got me home twice.
Q. What does an astronaut do when she comes back from space?
A. I'm currently on leave from my UCSD post to start Imaginary Lines.
What drove me to start the company was the sense that a lot of the stereotypes about girls and science and math that we all assumed would be gone by now, have not gone away.
Eleven-year-old girls still aren't encouraged quite as much as 11-year-old boys about science and math.
A girl might still feel negative pressure from her peers if she's the best one in the math class.
Yet, research shows that girls enjoy science as much as boys throughout elementary school.
It's in the middle-school years that they start to drift away.
And that's partly because of peer pressure.
So some friends and I decided we'd start programs to help girls get through those middle school years with their interest in science intact.
And we'd do it by creating programs that girls think are fun _ science festivals, science camps, science clubs _ that girls can go to with their friends, and that will connect them to each other and role models.
It's no secret that I've been reluctant to use my name for things.
I haven't written my memoirs or let the television movie be made about my life.
HEAD OF SHUTTLE PANEL CALLS FOR NEW AND SAFER CRAFT
With increased vigilance, the space shuttle can be flown safely for a few more years, but it should be replaced as soon as possible, the heed0mf the panel that investigated the Columbia accident said on Thursday.
Harold W.Gehman Jr., the retired admiral who heads the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, told a House science committee hea{}73: International Space Station.
But if NASA wants to continue with human space flight, he said, it should hasten work on another vehicle to take over the job.
A new human spacecraft should be designed so that its crew is separated from the cargo, he said, making it easier to build in escape systems.
The hearing, following a similar one Wednesday before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, begins an intense period of congressional oversight over NASA and its plans to get the remaining three shuttles flying again.
Congress was in summer recess on Aug. 26 whmn2he 12-member Gehman panel released its 281-page report on the Columbia accident.
The panel found that a piece of insulating foam had struck the shuttle shortly after liftoff, causing a breach in its left wing.
That led to Columbia's destruction upon re-entry on Feb. 1 and the death of its seven-person crew.
Sherwood Boehlert, the Republican from New York who is chairman of the science committee, said he would hold hearings as often as once a week to dissect the accident board report and determine what NASA must do to reform its operations and begin flying people again.
The committee has scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to review a preliminary NASA plan to return to shuttle flights.
The plan is to be released on Monday.
``We need to make fundamental decisions about the future of the shuttle program and of the manned space flight program,'' Boehlert said.
Better defining a vision of human space flight requires a new appraisal of costs, benefits and risks of different options, he said, and Congress will take an active role in the process.
``We have a rare chance to reshape our nation's space program,'' Boehlert said.
``We've got to be part of the solution.''
Gehman accepted Boehlert's invitation to have the investigation panel co/e back in a year and testify on how well NASA has followed its recommendations.
The panel is to complete its work and disband by the end of September.
SLOW-GOING FOR NASA AS IT READIES SHUTTLE FOR RETURN TO SPACE
A year after investigators concluded that the space shuttle Columbia was lost because of a damaged wing and a flawed approach to safety at NASA, agency officials said on Thursday that they have made significant progress in making shuttles safer and changing the way they do business.
William Readdy, NASA's associate administrator for space operations, said the agency noted a year ago that returning shuttles to flight would be difficult, and that has proven to be the case.
"It's been a year of ups and downs," he said at a news conference.
NASA has satisfied five of 15 mandatory recommendations that investigators said had to be completed before the next shuttle launch.
"We think we have progress to close the remaining 10 items here by December," Readdy said.
If preparations stay on schedule, the shuttle Discovery is to take off between March 16 and April 18.
Although the shuttle is to carry some supplies to the International Space Station, the flight will be seen as a test of the changes in the spacecraft and its operation.
Astronauts would not resume construction of the station until a third flight.
After a period of inspecting and overhauling Discovery to include new safety features, Parsons said engineers are getting into the "familiar territory" of preparing the shuttle for flight as they have for two decades.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
On Aug. 26, 2003, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board released its final report on the destruction of the space shuttle when it returned from a mission on Feb. 1 of that year, resulting in the deaths of its seven-member crew.
The panel, led by Adm.
Harold W.Gehman Jr., retired, said Columbia was lost because a big piece of insulating foam from the shuttle's main fuel tank broke free at launch and smashed a hole in one of the shuttle's wings that no one noticed.
Upon re-entry, hot gases entered the breach causing the breakup of the spacecraft.
Poor communications, complacency and numerous missteps contributed to the disaster, the panel said.
Dr.John M.Logsdon, director of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute and a member of the investigation panel, said it has been harder for NASA to return shuttles to space than investigators anticipated.
As engineers looked into the shuttle system, he said, they found many other things that needed fixing, validating the concerns of the board, and took time to do it.
"NASA was stung hard by the criticism and is determined not to fall into any traps," Logsdon continued.
"When the shuttle flies again, it will be safer than at any time in the life of the program."
Dr.Thomas Krause, chairman of Behavioral Science Technology Inc., of Ojai, Calif., who was hired to help reform NASA culture and internal communications, told a news conference that the agency was making progress on this front, also.
Company agents have been analyzing and coaching key leaders of the agency at its headquarters and at several centers.
"We are seeing leaders beginning to do things differently," Krause said.
Krause said meetings at the agency appear to be more open and leaders are doing better at seeking more opinions, including dissenting ones.
"If present activities continue, I see NASA being successful," he said.
The goal, he said, was to reduce the chances of the shuttle being hit by any foam that could harm it and to give astronauts in space the capacity to fix any damage that might occur.
When the shuttle returns to flight, officials said, there would be improved capabilities to inspect it at launch and in space, and the tools to repair damage to its thermal protection systems before returning.
While there is as yet no ability to repair large holes or tears such as the one that doomed Columbia, they said, the emphasis was on preventing such damage from occurring.
As NASA prepares to return the space shuttle to orbit this spring, there is a running debate inside and outside the space agency over whether the fleet is as safe as it should be.
There is widespread agreement that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, prodded by a searing report from the panel that investigated the loss of the shuttle Columbia two years ago, has made the fleet safer, and that the agency is moving full speed toward launching as early as May.
Columbia broke up over Texas as it returned to earth on the morning of Feb. 1, 2003, killing the seven astronauts onboard.
A hole that had been punched in the leading edge of Columbia's left wing by an errant piece of insulating foam some 81 seconds after liftoff 16 days earlier had let superheated gas into the wing during re-entry.
It was the worst space disaster since the loss of the shuttle Challenger and its seven-member crew in 1986.
The independent board that investigated the Columbia disaster recommended goals for the short term that included prevention of future foam damage and gaining the ability to inspect and repair shuttles in orbit.
For the long term, the board recommended measures to fix the "broken safety culture" that it said had led to the disaster.
The 15 return-to-flight recommendations, the report said, represented "the minimum that must be done to essentially fix the problems that were identified by this accident."
But since then, NASA officials have distanced themselves from those promises, arguing that because they have made significant strides on many safety issues, the need is not as pressing to meet the technical specifications for others.
-- The accident board recommended that NASA develop a "practicable capability" to inspect the shuttle while it is in orbit and repair damage to its thermal-protection system.
NASA now says it will not be able to make any but the most minor repairs in space.
A multimillion-dollar "goo gun" has proved disappointing.
Allard Beutel, a NASA spokesman, said the word "practicable" provided a degree of flexibility in fulfilling the recommendations.
-- A plan to use the International Space Station as a "safe haven" for astronauts from a damaged shuttle -- a goal not required by the accident investigation board but taken on by NASA as a way to make up for the inability to repair damage in space -- would have little chance of success under many circumstances envisioned by the agency itself, according to internal agency documents and Sergei K.Krikalev, the veteran Russian astronaut who will be commander on the next shift on the station and who echoed the view in comments this month to reporters.
NASA appointed a task force to monitor its progress in complying with the recommendations of the accident board.
That task force, led by two former astronauts, Richard O.Covey and Thomas Stafford, is expected to make its final determination of NASA's progress next month, but it already appears to be willing to allow NASA some slack.
In a report on Jan. 28, it said that the work left undone included "some of the toughest technological challenges the recommendations present," and that the accident board's recommendations need not be carried out to the letter so long as the activities resulted in "reduced risk" overall.
And it added, "NASA must be vigilant to prevent the development of a false sense of security by accepting faulty assumptions or otherwise inappropriate analyses, to justify return to flight."
NASA officials say that no shuttle mission can be risk-free and that the agency has generally raised safety levels enough to justify returning to flight.
That assertion is supported by Harold W.Gehman, the retired admiral who was chairman of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.
If NASA stops large pieces of foam from hitting the tank, he continued, it does not have to do a "super whiz-bang job of in-orbit repair."
"Going ahead half-cocked and losing a third orbiter for known defects will affect the rest of history in ways that are immeasurable, and lead to the demise of NASA as we know it," said another member of the Columbia accident board, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
NASA is under pressure to return the shuttle fleet to space in part because of President Bush's goal of completing the International Space Station by 2010 and beginning human exploration of the moon and Mars.
The space station cannot be finished without heavy equipment and supplies that can be carried only on the shuttle.
"The funding for the vision is based on the assumption that they can retire the shuttle by 2010," said a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the rules of his job.
"That depends on five flawless shuttle flights a year, which is more than can be plausibly planned for," considering the complexity of getting shuttles into space.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
After the investigation board recommended that NASA develop on-orbit repair capability, O'Keefe carried a cheap foam paintbrush in his pocket that he said might be used to spread the patching putty -- both to show the agency's commitment to the goal, and its unconventional thinking.
NASA internal memorandums tell of the degree of uncertainty within the development effort.
The first order of business, redesigning the part of the shuttle that the largest chunks of foam have fallen off of, was hailed as a success, but it was being changed before the Columbia disaster.
Other changes have been made in the fuel tank to prevent formation of ice along and to reduce foam shedding.
The next steps have not gone as smoothly, internal documents show.
A copy of a July 15 presentation by a team working through the tile issues described numerous problems with the filler, which is made of two compounds taken to space and blended by a "goo gun" before application.
Any deviation from the smooth surface of the orbiter, even by fractions of an inch, could have a significant effect on the aerodynamics of the shuttle upon entry into the atmosphere.
It would not be possible to tell if the compounds were improperly mixed or if the material was hardening properly, but accidentally applying only one of the compounds "results in a contaminated repair site, from which no recovery has been demonstrated nor planned for."
The presentation says the equipment being developed and tested is only a partial solution, at best:
Other concerns are underscored in red in the presentation, including those that suggest that some of the repair and re-entry options will be incorporated into the return-to-flight plan before they can be tested -- or without the capability of being fully tested.
A slide depicting a range of tile damage states that in some cases, "likely a 'gap' will exist between on-orbit inspection capability/plan and damage possibility that could be catastrophic."
Other documents show uncertainty in other aspects of the effort to return to flight.
They suggest that NASA still does not really know how much foam the shuttle's enormous external fuel tank will shed.
NASA officials said last month that they had changed the process of applying foam so that pieces no larger than 0.01 pounds would fall off the tank, well below the 0.023-pound chunks that can cause critical damage, according to new research by the agency.
Another presentation discusses when to call for external inspection, repairs and deciding whether it is safe to return to earth.
The problem -- or, as the presentation puts it, "why we got nervous" -- was the sheer number of gouges found on the shuttle in more than 100 flights.
There have been some 15,000 "tile-damage events" in the life of the shuttle program, and each shuttle flight includes an average of 24 nicks or gouges of 2 inches or less.
On average, a gouge of 10 inches has occurred in nearly one flight in five.
Figuring out when to call for inspection and when to call for repair is crucial, or every spaceflight will be turned over to repairing nicks in the craft with untested tools, and using up time and money that is needed for other things.
NASA officials say they recognize these problems.
But they said shuttle astronauts would have an extra margin of safety from the "safe haven" plan, which would allow a damaged shuttle to dock at the International Space Station until a rescue mission could be mounted.
That plan, however, has large risks of its own.
Getting to the station's orbit would be anything but certain in a damaged craft.
NASA internal documents suggest that the station lacks adequate support systems and supplies to assure that its own occupants and a shuttle crew could stay alive for more than a few months at best and a few weeks at worst -- not enough time, under many possible situations outlined in the documents, to carry off a rescue plan.
Meanwhile, the space station, which has been occupied since 2000, is itself troubled, with its crew scaled back from three people to two after the loss of Columbia.
Crucial systems like the oxygen generator have malfunctioned repeatedly, and supplies are dwindling without the freight-hauling capacity of the shuttles to resupply the station.
Beutel, the NASA spokesman, said safety on all fronts would continue to be improved in the test bed of space.
"Once we get back to flying, it's not over with R and D.
Just because we're back to flying, it doesn't mean we're not going to improve for the rest of the shuttle missions."
But people who have the most direct interest in a safe shuttle say they are ready to fly.
THREE KEY SAFETY ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED, BUT NASA WILL STILL CONSIDER JULY LAUNCH DATE FOR DISCOVERY
Though NASA has made strides in lowering the risks from space shuttle flights, the agency has failed to fully meet three key safety recommendations set forth by the Columbia accident board for resuming launches, an oversight panel said Monday.
The ruling from the Return to Flight Task Group comes with just a few weeks remaining in NASA's timetable for launching the shuttle Discovery with seven astronauts on the first mission since Columbia's fatal breakup more than two years ago.
The task group found shortcomings in NASA's efforts to eliminate losses of foam and ice from the shuttle's towering external fuel tank; adequately strengthen areas of the spacecraft vulnerable to critical damage from debris impacts; and equip the astronauts with a reliable repair kit.
The ruling of the task force will be a factor, but not necessarily an obstacle, when the space agency decides if it will stick with its plans to launch Discovery between July 13 and 31.
"I think you need to look at what the agency has done, not necessarily a score card," said Richard Covey, the former astronaut who co-chaired the 26-member task force of aerospace, risk-assessment and management experts.
"I don't think a score card is the way to look at it."
More than a 100 shuttle program officials will gather at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Wednesday and Thursday to formally review the Columbia recovery effort and set an official launch date.
NASA administrator Michael Griffin, who will participate in the two-day flight readiness review, has said he will carefully weigh the task force's deliberations when he joins his management team in making the final decision.
Today, Griffin will appear before the House Science Committee to discuss Discovery's readiness and other issues facing the nation's human spaceflight program.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board issued its recommendations after a wide-ranging inquiry into the causes of the Feb. 1, 2003, Columbia tragedy.
Struck under the left wing at liftoff by a 1.67-pound chunk of break-away fuel-tank insulation, the stricken shuttle was ripped apart as hot gases entered the breach during the high-velocity descent to Earth.
With only blurred, recorded views of the strike to work with, mission managers erroneously concluded that the foam chunk was not massive enough to cause critical damage.
The Columbia crew was informed of the blow but told not to be concerned.
As a result of the reforms initiated by the investigation, future shuttle launchings will be tracked by dozens of ground and airborne cameras.
The spacecraft's heat shield will be inspected thoroughly after liftoff.
If there is critical damage, the crew of a crippled shuttle will take refuge on the international space station until a rescue mission can be launched.
The task group characterized the recommendations that NASA has been unable to fully satisfy as the most difficult established by the investigation board.
The space agency has focused most of its recovery effort on the elimination of fuel-tank debris.
In late April, Griffin delayed plans to launch the shuttle in mid-May in order to initiate a new round of efforts to cut the threat posed by ice that forms on the chilled fuel tank from moisture in the Florida air.
Space agency experts said Friday that those efforts have significantly cut -- but not eliminated -- the possibility that flying ice might strike the edge of a shuttle wing or slice into a seal around the landing-gear doors on the underside of the spacecraft.
More analysis is under way, and the space agency is devising new criteria for the inspection team that will scan the shuttle for ice just before liftoff.
If inspectors find large deposits of ice in a new worry zone, the countdown would likely grind to a halt.
Late last year, the space agency acknowledged difficulties in devising repair tools and techniques that could withstand temperature extremes and the vacuum of space.
The crews of the next two shuttle missions will carry experimental repair kits.
What's left for NASA is to put all of these things together ..and assess what they believe to be the residual risk before they fly."
NASA SET TO RETURN DISCOVERY TO SPACE ON JULY 13
NASA will return the space shuttle Discovery to space next month, after almost two and a half years on the ground since the loss of the shuttle Columbia, officials said Thursday.
"This is a very major milestone on our path to return to flight," William Readdy, the associate administrator for space operations, said.
"We said immediately after the accident that we would find out what happened, we would fix it and we would return to flying again."
If all goes as planned, the shuttle carrying Cmdr.Eileen Collins and her crew -- Jim Kelly, the pilot; Steve Robinson; Wendy Lawrence; and Charlie Camarda, all of the United States; Andy Thomas of Australia; and Soichi Noguchi of Japan -- is to lift off at 3:51 p.m. for a 12-day mission.
It is to carry 15 tons of supplies and equipment to the International Space Station.
During their time aloft, the crew members will test new procedures for inspecting the shuttle's fragile skin for damage and for repairing damage.
Three spacewalks are also planned, one involving the replacement of an ailing station gyroscope.
The decision to fly comes after more than two years of study and struggle since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven on Feb. 1, 2003.
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board, or CAIB, found that an errant piece of insulating foam had punched a hole in the shuttle's left wing during the launching, and the hole led to disastrous overheating during re-entry.
Since then, NASA has worked to reduce the sources of ice and foam debris.
But on Monday, a NASA panel led by two former astronauts concluded that NASA had not fully met the three most challenging of the accident board's recommendations, including the development of tile and panel repair kits and measures to eliminate all shedding of debris from the external fuel tank.
"However," the report said, "the inability to fully comply with all of the CAIB recommendations should not imply that the space shuttle is unsafe."
Instead, the final report described the risks of space flight in the terms that NASA itself uses: "It is impossible to drive the risk to zero."
That theme was sounded repeatedly at Thursday's news conference.
"As the years and the generations unroll, we will learn how to make it routine -- as we have done with airline travel after a hundred years.
So we have a ways to go."
The only flight that will ever be cleaner is the next one."
"If someone wants more, they are going to have to find smarter humans."
When asked how he would celebrate the launching, Readdy said: "This isn't about weighing anchor -- this is about when Discovery is back in the harbor here at the Kennedy Space Center after a successful mission.
At that point there will be plenty of celebrating."
At the same time, the coming flight is one of a dwindling number for the aging shuttle.
President Bush has called for its retirement by 2010, and Griffin has said that the 28 trips initially planned to complete the space station will be cut back to as few as 15.
Now, he added, "They're going to try to manage the risk as best they can."
DEBRIS STIRS CONCERNS ON SHUTTLE SAFETY
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
- Pieces of Discovery appeared to dislodge Tuesday during the first space shuttle launch since Columbia blew up 2F years ago, and scientists began studying photos to determine whether any of the debris will have an impact on a historic flight NASA hopes will rescue the US manned space program.
Early photos showed an inch-and-a-half piece of tile, or its covering, may have peeled off near the door covering the shuttle's nose landing gear, but NASA managers said late Tuesday afternoon that it was too early to tell whether the debris had compromised the shuttle's safety.
Debris falls off during every shuttle launch, although the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has worked to minimize it on Discovery.
The falling debris was more apparent this time because more than 100 cameras were trained on Discovery during liftoff and the early part of the flight.
Another piece of debris also appeared to fall off the external tank, according to video footage, but did not strike anything.
The shuttle also apparently struck a bird less than three seconds into the flight.
Insulating foam that fell off Columbia during liftoff pierced its heat shield and skin, later allowing hot gases into the shuttle during reentry.
All seven astronauts died in the ensuing explosion.
"It's very early ...I don't have any conclusions," John Shannon, flight operations and integration manager, said in Houston late Tuesday afternoon.
"We are seeing areas of the vehicle ...we have never seen before."
While engineers said changes to the shuttle design since the Columbia tragedy have minimized the chance that foam, ice, or other debris will fall off and damage the shuttle, NASA was unable to completely eliminate that possibility.
Engineers will now spend several days analyzing video and photographs from the cameras that were on the ground, in the air, and mounted on Discovery.
Astronauts also took pictures from the shuttle and will employ a robotic arm to inspect the outside of the craft.
It was unclear what will happen if NASA scientists discover the shuttle is damaged from falling debris.
In one scenario that has never been tested, NASA would have the shuttle crew wait in the cramped International Space Station for a rescue attempt by the shuttle Atlantis.
But the crew is also equipped with repair kits that include caulking guns and putty knives that they were going to test to determine whether heat-shield emergency repairs could be made in case of a puncture.
But NASA officials have previously indicated they do not want to attempt a real repair with the test kits, so it is unclear whether the kits might be used.
During the launch, the air rumbled and a wave of cheers went up at Kennedy Space Center as Discovery and its seven astronauts sliced through two puffy clouds and blue skies before disappearing for a 13-day mission to test new safety gear and deliver supplies to the space station.
More than 150,000 watched the fiery launch from nearby roadways and rooftops, marking the start of what NASA hopes to be a new era of confidence in space flight and more daring solar system travel.
"Today, Mother Nature smiled on us and I think the Columbia crew smiled on us too," said NASA associate administrator William Readdy.
There was no hint of the fuel sensor problem that forced NASA to scrub a mission attempt nearly two weeks ago just a few hours before launch.
NASA has worked to minimize the risk to Discovery of falling ice and foam during launch, according to an independent advisory group.
But the space agency failed to fully reduce that risk - or make the shuttle's skin durable enough to resist such an impact.
Collins is joined by pilot Jim Kelly and mission specialists Steve Robinson, Andy Thomas, Wendy Lawrence, Charles Camarda, and Japanese astronaut Soichi Noguchi.
Laura Bush watched the launch at Cape Canaveral with Florida Governor Jeb Bush and about 2,500 other NASA guests.
NASA needs the shuttle to fly again to bring as many as 28 loads of cargo to meet the obligations it has to the space station.
The agency plans to retire the aging fleet in 2010.
Bush has called for a new space era, to put an astronaut back on the moon by 2020, and then launch a mission to Mars.
NASA is developing a new vehicle to get astronauts there, but agency officials said it would be irresponsible not to fix and then finish the shuttle program's mission.
NASA has made hundreds of modifications to make the shuttle safer, including the camera system, to ensure the agency does "not proceed out of ignorance," said John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.
"There have been debris hits on every mission," he said.
"If you saw something fall off it doesn't necessarily mean it hit the thermal protection system."
Along Florida's Space Coast - and across the country - adults and children wished the astronauts a safe journey.
Viewers of NASA's broadcast at the McAuliffe Challenger Center at Framingham State College, named for teacher-astronaut Christa McAuliffe, who died on the Challenger, gasped as the shuttle went off.
Each time the announcer ticked off the shuttle's speed - 2,000 miles per hour, 3,033 miles per hour, 17,000 miles per hour - the crowd muttered in awe.
Globe correspondent Adam Jadhav contributed to this report.
SHUTTLE PROGRAM A STUDY IN CHANGE AND STABILITY
Since the 1980s, the story of NASA's human spaceflight program has been like the space shuttle itself: a study in stasis and change.
The shuttles reflect decades-old design and show their age.
But those who maintain the shuttle, manage it and chart its trajectory and its future know that it embodies transition as well, with regular upgrades like the modern "glass cockpit" digital display that replaced antiquated dials.
Many of the people of the space agency have remained while much around them has changed.
And more changes are expected once the Discovery mission is done.
Weather permitting, Discovery was scheduled to land as early as 4:47 a.m. on Monday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
But the changes made at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration between the Columbia mission and that of the Discovery have never been more evident than they were late last week, when the mission management team held its final discussion on whether to conduct a spacewalk to fix or remove a damaged insulating blanket near the commander's window on the Discovery.
An engineer spoke up to discuss the limitations of what the team knew.
While he did not voice deep concerns, he addressed differences between the degree of certainty that NASA requires for safety decisions before the shuttle can fly and those that take place during a mission.
"Almost the entire management structure has been changed out," N.Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program's deputy manager, said to reporters last month.
But "the engineers that have the data, that have the real smarts that make the program work, are still in place."
Rocha is not the only familiar face on the Discovery mission.
The flight director for launching and re-entry is LeRoy Cain, who led the entry team on Feb. 1, 2003, when the shuttle Columbia broke up over Texas.
The world observed his grief-stricken face and businesslike manner, and heard his curt "lock the doors" command that signaled it was time to give up hope for the crew and to flip open the notebooks laying out procedures for shuttle disasters.
Cain said 2005 is not 2003.
"We've learned a great deal about the vehicle," he said.
Since then, the NASA administrator at the time of the accident, Sean O'Keefe, has taken a job as chancellor of Louisiana State University.
William F.Readdy, a former astronaut who heads spaceflight operations, has said he will leave the agency after the Discovery flight, and more departures are likely as O'Keefe's successor, Michael D.Griffin, builds his own team.
At the Johnson Space Center, managers who ran the Columbia mission have departed or been reassigned.
Ronald D.Dittemore, the program manager at the time of the accident and a familiar face in the initial briefings that February, has left to become president of ATK Thiokol Propulsion, a shuttle contractor.
Linda Ham, who led the mission management team for the Columbia and quashed requests for outside help in getting images of the shuttle in flight, has been assigned to a less prominent role in the engineering directorate at the space center.
(Her husband, Kenneth T.Ham, is involved with the Discovery mission; an astronaut, he serves as Capcom, or capsule communicator during liftoff and landing.)
Dittemore and Linda Ham declined requests for interviews.
Ralph Roe Jr., who led the shuttle program office of vehicle engineering during the Columbia mission and whose part in turning down the imagery requests was described in the Columbia accident investigation report, was appointed to lead a new office at NASA's Langley Research Center devoted to providing independent safety analysis to the agency, a direct response to the accident.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Few on the current management team have spoken more often about the aftereffects of the Columbia accident than Hale, the deputy manager.
In 2003 he was manager for launch integration at Kennedy Space Center and was among the first to pass along Rocha's request for images of the shuttle.
His role was described in the final report of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board, known as CAIB.
The Columbia team had a small group of contractors use software for assessing damage that was inadequate to the task; it had been designed to measure foam debris hundreds of times smaller than the 1.67-pound hunk that blasted through the Columbia's wing.
"We're operating from a position base of knowledge," he said, "rather than some sort of guesstimate."
This has led to longer discussions of damage and no small amount of hand-wringing.
But Hale and the other mission managers said that this was the inevitable result of having so much information, and that they would much rather have the data than not.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
It should come as no surprise, McCurdy said, that NASA has retained people who shared responsibility for some of the Columbia mistakes, because changing personnel is not as important as fixing the underlying cultural problems.
"You can bring a new person in," he said, "and they will operate in the same way if the system hasn't changed."
The tendency to keep people in the agency goes back to the earliest days of the American space program and conserves hard-won expertise.
McCurdy said that Wernher von Braun, one of the pioneers of the program, "had a history of leaving people who made errors in place, because he figured they'd never make the same error again.
"But he also said, 'You make the same error twice, you're gone."'
The House majority leader, Rep.Dick Armey, warned on Thursday that an unprovoked attack against Iraq would violate international law and undermine world support for President Bush's goal of ousting Saddam Hussein.
``If we try to act against Saddam Hussein, as obnoxious as he is, without proper provocation, we will not have the support of other nation states who might do so,'' Armey told reporters in Des Moines during a campaign swing for a House candidate.
``It would not be consistent with what we have been as a nation or what we should be as a nation.''
President Bush has repeatedly stated that the administration's goal is to overthrow Saddam, in large part because of the threat Iraq's suspected programs to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear weapons pose to its neighbors as well as to American and allied forces in the region.
Armey did not directly address the issue of what the United States should do if it was determined that Iraq was continuing to build weapons of mass destruction.
Bush has carefully sidestepped the question of how and when the administration would accomplish its goal of ousting Saddam even as senior military commanders have presented options to the president and his top aides that range from invading Iraq with as many as 250,000 troops, to one involving 80,000 to 100,000 troops swooping in on Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, and other military centers in hopes of quickly collapsing the government.
Bush pledged this week that he would consult with Congress before ordering any invasion, but he stopped short of promising to ask for a vote authorizing an attack.
Leaders of Iraqi groups that oppose Saddam will meet here on Friday with senior State and Defense Department officials to discuss the policy to remove the Iraqi leader.
In Baghdad, Saddam organized a large military parade on Thursday to celebrate the anniversary of the end of the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war, and then delivered a television speech in which he warned ``the forces of evil'' not to attack Iraq.
Saddam has refused to deal with U.N. weapons inspectors since they left nearly four years ago, and Iraq remains under U.N. sanctions imposed at the time it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
At the end of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the lifting of those sanctions was linked to Iraq ending its programs of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the development of missiles to deliver them.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
``I don't see any change in attitude,'' Annan said.
In a televised speech, Saddam said that ``the forces of evil'' _ a play of words on Bush's inclusion of Iraq as being part of an ``axis of evil'' _ will ``die in disgraceful failure'' if Iraq is attacked.
``The Iraqi government needs to comply with the responsibilities it agreed to at the end of the gulf war,'' McClellan said.
``The president has not decided on a particular course of action and is keeping all his options open,'' McClellan said.
``Beyond that, it's speculating about hypotheticals.''
Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld have both said recently that the return of international inspectors to Iraq would not be enough to eliminate Saddam's hidden arsenal.
Rumsfeld said Iraq's actions to conceal weapons laboratories underground and put them on mobile trailers might make inspections useless.
On Thursday, Armey said that the failure to resume international arms inspections inside Iraq would be insufficient grounds for war.
``What if the French decided they wanted to inspect American military facilities?''
Armey said he had supported the Persian Gulf war.
But in this case, he said that basic principles of international law apply, and that attacking Iraq without a specific provocation would violate those norms.
Other prominent Republicans, including Sens.Richard Lugar of Indiana and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, have said recently said that the conditions for a pre-emptive strike against Iraq are not yet in place.
They and other lawmakers from both parties have recommended other steps first, including stricter enforcement of the no-flight zones.
This is the second instance recently in which Armey has challenged White House policy.
THE TOLL CASUALTIES WOULD TAKE ON WAR SUPPORT IS DIFFICULT TO
With Iraq war plans moving forward, an important unknown remains on the home front: The willingness of the American people to accept large numbers of dead or wounded soldiers.
Experts in Washington differ on whether high casualties would strengthen public resolve or turn opinion against the war.
Muddying the picture: The few casualties Americans have suffered in the nation's recent military excursions.
In the 1991 Persian Gulf War, in Kosovo and in Afghanistan, U.S. armed forces emerged remarkably unscathed, thanks to a combination of strength, training and technology.
As of mid-January, about 60 American fighters have been killed in what the military terms ``the global war on terror'' _ including a CIA operative caught in an Afghan prison uprising, a Marine downed in a drive-by shooting in Kuwait and a Green Beret hit in a Philippine restaurant bombing.
Only 18 of the deaths were classified as killed in action in Afghanistan.
The remainder died in aircraft crashes, accidents or incidents ranging from a drowning in Cuba to a lost helicopter crew in the Philippines.
Americans have reacted strongly when larger-than-expected casualties have been inflicted on U.S. forces.
In Vietnam in the 1960s, in Beirut, Lebanon, in the 1980s and in Somalia in the 1990s, public support for _ and official commitment to _ military operations began to fade when casualties mounted.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll last month showed that although more than 60 percent of respondents supported using force against Iraq, support dipped to 30 percent should the operation involve serious casualties.
Such bellicosity could prove as empty as Hussein's threat to ensure ``the mother of all battles'' in 1991.
But an invasion of Iraq would be vastly different than the Gulf War, which resulted in fewer than 150 combat-related deaths, experts warned.
The Persian Gulf War largely was fought in the open desert.
If the U.S. were to attack Iraq now, it is likely, as Hussein has threatened, that the elite Iraqi Republican Guard and Hussein loyalists would try to hold Baghdad, forcing street warfare on turf familiar to them.
The fear is that such fights could be akin to the Battle of Mogadishu, when 18 soldiers died and public support for the Somalia mission evaporated.
Then there is the increased threat of a cornered Hussein, who could turn to a cache of chemical and biological weapons.
American war planners understand such dangers, said Sen.Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican and incoming chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
``A great deal of planning has gone into what we can expect and to avoid Somalia-times-1,000,'' Roberts said.
``We do not want to become engaged in urban warfare or put our troops into a contaminated area.
There's a lot of groundwork being laid to avoid those kinds of situations.''
Ultimately, public support will depend on how well the case is made that the war is in American interests.
``Research suggests the American public will support interventions even if they produce casualties, if there is a convincing justification for U.S. involvement,'' said David Auerswald, a professor at the National War College in Washington.
``Public support seems to drop off if elected officials have not made a convincing case, or if there's a significant debate between elected officials on whether this is worthwhile.''
World Wars I and II, and even the early days of the Korean War, were examples of casualty-heavy engagements that drew public support, Auerswald said.
On the other hand, the public doubt about Vietnam, Beirut and Somalia came after heavy casualties were coupled with decreasing public understanding of the point of the mission, he said.
``If you are expecting a significant number of casualties and you want to maintain public support, you have to make sure you have a good rationale,'' Auerswald said.
That could be a challenge for the Bush administration.
To prepare the American people for casualties might risk softening support, as polls show.
To ignore that casualties may occur could cause outsized expectations for a quick, easy war.
In a private meeting earlier this month between Senate Republicans and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, Sen.Kit Bond of Missouri urged the administration to more clearly _ and more frequently _ explain the links between Iraq and the al-Qaida terrorist network.
``I think the American people will stand behind President Bush even if the going gets tough,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a defense policy expert at the Brookings Institution.
Even if Hussein uses his terror weapons and inflicts huge casualties, that could enhance support for the war, O'Hanlon said.
``If he uses them on our soldiers, people would see it as more likely that he would be willing to give them to al-Qaida in a terrorist attack,'' O'Hanlon said.
In 1990, during the buildup to the Persian Gulf War, similar concerns about the scope of potential American wounded abounded.
The war ended within weeks, with few casualties.
``No matter how strong you are, war is chaos.
You never know what's going to happen.''
Frustration has been building in Baghdad for several days and intensified Friday _ the second Muslim day of prayer since the regime fell.
``You are the masters today,'' one cleric, Ahmed al-Kubeisy, said in reference to the United States as he addressed worshipers at the Abu Haneefa al-Nu'man Mosque on Friday.
``And so while there will be some that want to see a departure of the coalition, some would like to have that so they can try to return power to the way it was,'' said Brigadier General Vincent Brooks, a spokesman for US Central Command in Qatar.
``Others may want to do that just to remind us that this is Iraq for the Iraqi people.
And we really don't need a reminder on that.
We're quite aware of that and we respect that.
As US officials Friday studied newly released video and audiotapes purportedly of Hussein, the hunt progressed for other top Ba'ath Party leaders.
Samir Abd al-Aziz, number 24 on the list of 55 most-wanted Iraqi leaders, was handed over to US special operations scribed as the regional Ba'ath Party commander of the Baghdad district.
``He is believed to have first-hand knowledge of the Ba'ath Party central structure,'' Brooks said.
Two half-brothers of Hussein captured in the last week were cooperating with investigators, Brooks added.
The mood in Baghdad has changed markedly since US Marines helped a throng of protesters tear down a Hussein statue just over a week ago.
Near the Baghdad Museum, a crowd of hundreds had gathered Friday with a crane to tear the head off one of the last mammoth statues of Hussein.
``Yes to Freedom, No to Saddam,'' they chanted.
Patience is in short supply in Baghdad, which has not had power, telephone service, or running water since before the invasion.
``Saddam was bad, the United States are worse.''
Two American humvees drove toward the mosque in the late afternoon, having lost their way.
``Get out before we hurt you!'' one man shouted.
The sentiment spans the major religious groups in Baghdad _ Shi'as, Sunni Muslims, and Christians.
``No one likes colonization,'' said Alaa Tawbiah, a Christian attending Good Friday services in Karada.
Unlike Shi'as, Christians faced no special state discrimination under Hussein's leadership.
``We drove the British out with sticks in 1920.
If the Americans try to stay, they'll get their due.''
Marines will withdraw from Baghdad on Saturday, turning over control of the capital city of 5 million people to the US Army.
The Army will take over all the administrative functions currently performed by the Marines, including training Iraqi police who are returning to duty.
Other fissures are beginning to break open in Baghdad.
Ahmed Chalabi, the exiled leader of the Iraqi National Congress, opened a headquarters Friday in the ritzy neighborhood of Mansur.
``He has been away so long, he has forgotten all about Iraq.''
Chalabi _ who is closely aligned with the United States, and has positioned a top aid as ``vizier'' of Baghdad as the head of an interim council _ tried to put some of that criticism to rest Friday.
``I am not a candidate for any position in the interim government,'' he said.
``I am a citizen of Iraq and I am home and I am expressing my views as a citizen of Iraq.''
On Thursday, Mohammed Mohsen Zubaidi announced he would head a new Baghdad city council, but would not say who had chosen him.
Chalabi told reporters Friday he believed US troops would turn control of the city over to an Iraqi-controlled council within weeks, but was vague about how that council would be selected.
Chalabi, mirroring the Bush administration's position, dismissed the role of theole,'' he said.
Given his close ties to the Pentagon, Chalabi also will have to surmount the suspicion of the United States voiced on the streets of Baghdad Friday.

CLOSING IN ON VIETNAM (FOR USE
IT IS $80 billion and halfway home to Vietnam.
The estimated cost of Vietnam in current dollars was $584 billion, according to the Congressional Research Office.
Iraq has already cost more in current dollars than either the Civil War or World War I. It is about to pass the Korean War.
We are on pace to pass Vietnam in two or three years.
As Bush appears dead set on certifying Iraq's elections, even if it has the credibility of the Florida recount, his $80 billion brings us closer to certifying Iraq as, in financial terms, the most terrifying war on terror in American history.
Daniels gave a cost of between $50 billion and $60 billion.
There was General Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff who dared to say in a Senate hearing that "something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" would be required after the invasion to maintain "control over a piece of geography that's fairly significant with the kinds of ethnic tensions that could lead to other problems."
Shinseki said, "It takes significant ground force presence to maintain a safe and secure environment to ensure that the people are fed, that water is distributed, all the normal responsibilities that go along with administering a situation like this."
With each supplemental request, Iraq becomes the most wildly off the mark mission since Vietnam, making the neo-cons the biggest con artists of our generation.
Once they were looking for Osama.
They forgot him trying to find Saddam Hussein.
They claimed Saddam had weapons of mass destruction pointed at American air ducts and waterways.
Vice President Dick Cheney once boasted that American forces would be "greeted as liberators.
" Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he had "broad and deep evidence" that once Saddam was captured, his former soldiers would throw down their arms and lock arms in celebration over a free Iraq.
But even the very capture of Saddam did not stop the tailspin of chaos.
Nearly two years after the invasion, Iraq more resembles civil war than civil society.
There were just as many attacks against US soldiers, Iraqi police, and civilians in the last month, 2,736, as there were in September.
Politically, Bush has nowhere to go but Vietnam.
On the very same day that Bush said, "Millions of Iraqi voters will show their bravery, their love of country, and their desire to live in freedom," one of the American unit commanders in Baghdad said the nation's capital was still "enemy territory."
While Bush was declaring in a most personal way, "I firmly planted the flag of liberty," Raad al-Naqib, a Baghdad dentist, told the New York Times, "The Americans, they are part of the terrorism.
With the predictions of a protracted occupation becoming more solid by the day, comparisons of Iraq with the costliest war in American history are no longer out of the question.
In today's dollars, World War II cost $2.9 trillion.
Yale economist William Nordhaus predicted a long conflict in Iraq might cost up to $1.9 trillion.
Economist Warwick McKibbin, a board member of the Australian central bank, said a conflict lasting to 2010 could cost more than $3.5 trillion.
It is certain that we are there in a massive way until close to 2010.
Bush said in April 2004 that American forces would stay "not one day more" than necessary.
But his military's own assessment is that it will take three to five years to train a competent Iraqi security force.
Once upon a time, Bush and the neo-cons promised a rout so complete that they talked openly about a "catastrophic success" in which grateful Iraqis might stampede American troops and create a humanitarian crisis.

U.S. MILITARY NEARS A GRIM MILESTONE IN IRAQ
It's a grim milestone that no one wants to see come about, but the United States is nearing 2,000 military deaths in Iraq.
With public opinion polls showing that a majority of Americans favor a partial or total withdrawal from Iraq 32 months after President Bush launched an invasion to oust Saddam Hussein, experts and advocates disagree on whether the looming benchmark will further erode public or congressional support for the war that the president promises to continue until a successful conclusion.
As of Friday, the official Defense Department tally of Americans killed in Iraq stood at 1,983, while the unofficial Web site Iraq Coalition Casualty Count put the total at 1,992.
About 15,200 American military personnel have been wounded in the war.
Totals on Iraqis killed since March 2003 are only estimates, ranging from 15,500 to 72,100 if victims of violent crime since Hussein fell in April 2003 are included, according to the Brookings Institution's Iraq index.
United for Peace and Justice, a group that has organized anti-war protests around the country, plans small commemorations the day after the Pentagon's official count reaches the 2,000 mark.
"In practical terms, these are not going to be big-scale events," said Bill Dobbs, the group's national media coordinator in New York.
"But they'll be poignant reminders that that there have been too many deaths.
I think more people are going to say end it."
...
He said the military effort in Iraq is directly related to the worldwide war against terrorism.
At current levels of losses in Iraq, "It would take 200 years or so to lose that many in this war on Islamic totalitarianism," he said.
Maj.Gen.William G.Webster, the commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, said Friday that it will take up to two years for the Iraqi army to have the military leadership and supplies it needs to operate on its own.
Webster did not say how that would affect any potential withdrawal of American troops from Iraq.
Passing the 2,000-death barrier in itself won't sway much of the public, said John Mueller, an expert on war and public opinion at Ohio State University, because polls show much of the public has already turned against the war.
For instance, a CBS survey early this month showed Americans disapprove of the way Bush is handling Iraq by 62 percent to 34 percent.
By 59 percent to 36 percent, those polled said American forces should leave Iraq as soon as possible.
"The issue is that casualties keep accumulating and support for the war is very low, no matter how you measure it.
It just erodes," Mueller said.
Given that erosion, Mueller said even eventual victory in Iraq won't improve the public sentiment about the war.
"There is no way to regain support.
Those disaffected will still say it cost too much and it isn't worth the cost," he said.
Speaking from Baghdad via video conference, Webster was asked by Pentagon reporters Friday about the looming 2,000 death toll.
We grieve every one of these losses.
But Rep.Lynn Woolsey, D-Calif., a leader in congressional efforts to push for withdrawal from Iraq, said the reaching the 2,000 mark will send a signal to her colleagues.
"There is a change of sentiment among the American people, and Congress had better catch up.
...
People are getting fed up," she said.
Woolsey is circulating a letter among her colleagues urging Bush to change course by getting the United Nations and NATO involved in Iraq and intensifying plans for post-conflict reconstruction, using experts from places such as Northern Ireland and South Africa that are rebuilding after long conflicts.
"I think the American people are going to insist" that Bush change course on Iraq, she said.
BUSH CAMPAIGNS TO SELL WAR IN IRAQ
President Bush has launched a marketing blitz to overcome public concerns, Democratic criticism and Republican worries about the war in Iraq and the broader U.S. campaign against Islamic terroism that has lasted longer than World War II.
His new public relations offensive takes place amid mounting U.S. casualties in Iraq and suicide bombing attacks in Jordan -- a key U.S. ally -- that killed at least 57 and wounded at least 120 people.
Richard Falkenrath, a former homeland security official in the Bush administration, said Bush has become so concerned by the shifting political dynamic that he had to abandon talking about "his forward-looking strategy for the war on terror" to focus instead on rebutting his critics.
Bush, who leaves Monday for a week-long trip to Asia, lashed out Friday at critics of the 32-month U.S. campaign to pacify Iraq and bolster the U.S.-backed, democratically elected government in Baghdad.
Bush spoke against a backdrop of nationwide public opinion polls showing that his job-approval rating is at the lowest of his presidency and that support for the war in Iraq is waning.
The U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have claimed the lives of at least 2,065 American soldiers and wounded at least 15,353 other GIs, with no announced deadline for U.S. withdrawal.
International authorities estimate that at least 30,000 Iraqis have died.
The Pentagon last month told Congress that at least 26,000 Iraqis had been killed or wounded by insurgents since Jan. 1, 2004 -- nine months after the U.S. invasion and occupation began.
Fifty-two percent of respondents in an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll released Friday said the war had not been worth the casualties or costs; 40 percent said the burdens were worth it.
A CBS News survey released last month found 66 percent of respondents felt the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq had made them either less safe or made no difference, compared to 32 percent who said they felt safer.
Libby pleaded not guilty on Nov. 3 to five felony charges stemming from an alleged effort to obstruct a federal investigation into White House officials' unmasking of an undercover CIA agent to retaliate against her husband, an Iraqi war critic.
Meanwhile, synchronized suicide bombing attacks at three Jordanian hotels last week underscored the continuing threat of al-Qaida operations beyond the combat zone in Iraq.
The attacks -- the fifth al-Qaida-linked bombings against U.S. allies this year -- boosted the cumulative toll of al-Qaida attacks to more than 4,000 killed and more than 15,000 wounded in the United States and 14 other countries since 1992.
Army Maj.Gen.Rick Lynch said the attacks in Jordan illustrated the continued punch of Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaida in Iraq.
"That will continue," Lynch said in Baghdad.
"That's why we will continue our operations to deny him that capability."
Democrats continue to press Bush on Iraq with an eye on the 2006 mid-term congressional elections, following Republican setbacks in last Tuesday's off-year elections.
Democrats won terms as governors of traditionally Democratic New Jersey and traditionally Republican Virginia, where Bush had campaigned for the defeated GOP candidate.
"The commander-in-chief should honor our men and women in uniform with a clear strategy for success in Iraq," Kerry said Friday.
Rep.Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House Democratic leader, said Bush was trying to "bolster his political standing on the war in Iraq."
Bush also faces restiveness among Republicans led by Sen.John McCain, R-Ariz., a prospective GOP presidential candidate in 2008.

FIRST SUSPECTED CASE OF MYSTERY ILLNESS IDENTIFIED IN VALLEY(a)
(For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)
By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER(a)c.2003 The Arizona Republic(a)
(PHOENIX) - The state's first suspected case of SARS, a mysterious pneumonia that is sweeping the globe, has been identified in the Valley.
Maricopa County health officials said the patient is a man who had traveled recently through Hong Kong.
He was hospitalized with symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and is expected to be released soon from a hospital and to be isolated at home for up to 10 days.
Health officials declined to release the man's name or any other identifying information.
They also would not identify the hospital where he is being treated.
Jonathan Weisbuch, Maricopa County director of public health, said, ``The general public does not appear to be at risk for infection,'' but he warned residents to seek medical attention if they exhibit any SARS symptoms.
The highly contagious disease is characterized by a dry, unproductive cough with a fever of 100.4 or higher and is believed to affect individuals who have recently traveled to China or Vietnam.
As of Monday, 17 countries have reported 2,601 cases of SARS, with 100 deaths.
Cases of the disease are still on the rise.
In the United States, 115 cases in 29 states had been reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Friday.
By Monday, the number had grown to 141 cases, according to the World Health Organization.
No deaths have been reported in the United States, although SARS patients have died in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
For the past several weeks, state and county health officials have investigated 17 suspected cases of SARS, said Dr. Larry Sands, Maricopa County medical director for the division of epidemiology and biodefense preparedness and response.
None except the case reported to CDC officials Monday turned out to be the syndrome; those were cases of other types of respiratory ailm perform sophisticated laboratory testing, including using electron microscopes and genetic screens of the virus, Sands said.
He added that he does not know the timetable for when the tests will be completed.
SARS cases surround Arizona geographically, with California reporting the largest number for a single state.
But Dr. Robert Baron, co-director of the emergency department at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Phoenix, urged residents to take the news in stride.
``We can't think that every time someone gets a fever right now they have SARS,'' Baron said.
Instead, individuals must have a travel history to China or other affected areas or they must have had close contact with someone who has been in the affected areas to meet the case definition set by the World Health Organization and the CDC.
Dr. John Shufeldt, an emergency department physician at St.Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, said he recently had a patient who met the SARS case definition.
But a chest X-ray and other tests revealed the patient did not have SARS.
``You just know by the severity of the symptoms and how quickly they advance,'' he said.
But he also said that if more suspected SARS cases appear in the Valley, the disease could strain hospitals and physicians.
``If it hits outbreak status, everyone will think they have SARS,'' he said.
``It's going to be tough to diagnose.''
IN HONG KONG, INFECTED MAN'S ITINERARY RAISES TRAVEL FEARS
In a striking example of how far and fast a virus can be carried in an era of international jet travel, health officials announced here on Thursday night that a man infected with a new respiratory disease had flown from Hong Kong to Munich, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Frankfurt, Germany; London; Munich again; Frankfurt again and then back to Hong Kong before entering a hospital.
The Hong Kong Department of Health appealed Thursday night for passengers and air crews from all seven flights to contact medical professionals.
A Health Department spokeswoman said that it was not yet known whether the man, who is 48, had infected anyone else on the flights with SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome.
All of the flights were on Lufthansa.
The airline said in a statement Thursday night that it had disinfected all of the airplanes and was contacting the air crews and passengers, and contended that the likelihood of anyone becoming infected during the flights was ``very remote.''
But according to the health department here, at least 13 people have fallen sick with SARS so far after they shared a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing last month with an elderly man who had become infected with the disease while visiting his brother in a hospital here.
Thursday night's appeal for the Lufthansa air crews and passengers to come forward follows nearly a dozen such appeals by health officials and airlines operating flights in and out of Hong Kong.
Travelers have continued to board planes while feeling unwell despite strenuous warnings from the World Health Organization and national health agencies that they not do so.
In the case announced Thursday night, the man flew on Lufthansa flight 731 on March 30 from Hong Kong to Munich, and traveled on the following day on flight 4316 to Barcelona, ac!ording to an itinerary released here by the Health Department.
The man then developed symptoms while in Barcelona.
He then traveled on flight 4303 to Frankfurt on April 2 and on to London the same day on flight 4520.
He went to Munich the next day on flight 4671, then headed for Frankfurt on April 4 on flight 265.
He connected with flight 738 the same day back to Hong Kong, arriving on April 5.
The man checked into a hospital here on April 8 and was confirmed on Thursday to have SARS.
Doctors do not yet know how infectious, if at all, people are in the early stages of SARS.
Increasingly, doctors are suspicious that some people may be able transmit the disease before the symptoms begin.
Dr.Yeoh Eng-kiong, Hong Kong's secretary for health, welfare and food, warned Thursday night that doctors here had become infected from people who had not yet shown the full symptomsO identified by the WHO.
Yeoh suggested that even someone with diarrhea alone could be infectious.
The sick man's nationality was a mystery Thursday night.
The Health Department statement did not identify it at all, while the airlcompany had only been told by the Health Department here that the man was Chinese.
The Health Department spokeswoman said that the man seemed to be of Chinese descent but that the agency had been unable to determine the man's nationality.
``He travels a lot,'' the spokeswoman said.
``We don't know his passport.''
Hong Kong still issues separate passports from mainland China, a legacy of its days as a former British colony.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
The infected man's odyssey could not come at a worse time for Hong Kong, as countries have begun limiting the entry of people traveling from here or imposing quarantines on them.
Malaysia stopped issuing visas on Thursday to practically all holders of Hong Kong and mainland China passports.
Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's main airline, announced Thursday night that it had suspended all flights to Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur airport because there were very few passengers left.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
Singapore also imposed on Thursday a 10-day quarantine on all foreign workers earning less than $24,000 a year who have recently been in a SARS-affected country or territory.
Employers must pay all costs of the quarantine.
Singapore has been trying for years to lure high-income expatriates in financial services and other lucrative industries, while making it harder for lower-income workers to immigrate and do jobs that less-educated Singaporeans might otherwise do.
Hong Kong's economy depends heavily on its role as Asia's transportation hub, the place from which businesses can control and coordinate factories and other businesses spread across the continent.
Hono kkng has the world's busiest container port for sea freight, the world's busiest airport for international air cargo shipments and what was, until recently, Asia's busiest airport in terms of international air passenger departures.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
But the av!ilbility of flights here is withering as many governments have warned their citizens not to visit and many businesses have ordered their employees not to travel here.
Cathay Pacific has canceled a quarter of its daily flights here.
Dragonair, an affiliated carrier that dominates passenger travel from Hong Kong to cities in mainland China, has stopped operating almost half its flights.
Continental Airlines canceled its daily, non-stop flight from Hong Kong to New York earlier this week for lack of passengers.
The Airport Authority here said that a third of all flights originally scheduled to operate on Thursday had been canceled for various reasons.
Health officials have said that the virus causing SARS can probably survive no more than several hours outside the body, so that air and sea cargo shipments from Hong Kong, as well as mail, do not pose a risk to recipients.
HOUSTON MALL HIT BY FEARS OF SARS
There's the tale of the seafood chef who died from SARS.
Some say an elderly woman at the shopping center succumbed to the flulike disease.
Others say city health authorities are shuttering the place because it's contaminated.
Scary stuff _ except none of it, upon investigation, appears true.
``We've been hearing those same rumors,'' said Kathy Barton, a spokeswoman for the Houston Department of Health and Human Services.
``I think there is a great deal of panic.
I think there also may be a little bit of ...
competitive rivalry going on (between shopping centers).''
Although no one in the United States has died from the mysterious pneumonia from southern China, and Texas has only five suspected casesl nxiety about severe acute respiratory syndrome is unnerving people in Asian shopping districts throughout the country.
In some cities, tourists and diners are staying away.
Hong Kong City Mall, the biggest shopping center in Houston's New Chinatown, on the southwest side, seems to be a particular focus of gossip _ perhaps because of its name, some speculate, or because of business competition from older shopping centers such as Diho Square.
``Oh, your office is open?'' callers ask Dawn Lin, an attorney whose office is on the second floor of Hong Kong City Mall.
``I thought they closed down the whole mall,'' they say.
Worldwide, there have been 2,890 SARS cases and 116 deaths.
There are 166 U.S. cases in 31 states.
There is no treatment for SARS and about 95 percent of those who get the disease recover.
Symptoms ibreath.
Health officials have attempted to put the SARS threat in perspective, pointing out that the ordinary flu kills an estimated 20,000 Americans each year.
They also stress that SARS doesn't appear out of nowhere.
``We would have no reason to expect a chef out of the clear blue sky to be sick without the critical ingredient: foreign travel,'' said Barton, adding that secondary cases have been transmitted to family members and health care workers, not people encountered in a casual setting like the grocery store.
In addition, someone sick with SARS would not likely go unnoticed, Barton said.
Once the high fever and difficult breathing kicked in, an infected person would go to the hospital where doctors are on the lookout for SARS.
If the person's travel history checked out, he or she would be added to the list of suspected cases.
At that point, city health investigators would track down other people potentially infected by the patient.
``We would make some attempt to warn people, or alert people who might have had infectious exposure,'' Barton said.
Nevertheless, the gossip`peSsists.
Gerald Wu, 25, who was sipping a tapioca tea drink at Diho Square on Bellaire Boulevard, said some of his co-workers told him they are avoiding Chinatown for now.
He said immigrants with a distrust of government in their native countries may be fueling conspiracy theories about SARS deaths in Houston.
Indeed, business at the Hong Kong City Mall has been slow this week.
One restaurant owner reported a higher number of customers taking their food to go, rather than eating there.
``I don't know if it's the economy, the war or SARS,'' said a banker.
On Thursday, Lin was eating in a restaurant when she heard someone cough.
These days, such a sound puts her on instant alert.
``I turn my head and hold my breath and walk as far as I can without breathing,'' she said.
Lonnie Han, who works in a cell phone kiosk in the mall, is skeptical that a SARS outbreak at the mall would remain cloaked in secrecy.
Nevertheless, she is taking extra precautions against the disease by swabbing down her countertops with alcohol.
``It's just people.
People gossip like crazy,'' Han said.

IN HONG KONG, YOUNGER AND HEALTHIER VICTIMS SUCCUMBING TO SARS
The respiratory disease known as SARS is beginning to kill younger and healthier adults as well as older people here, as medical treatments are proving somewhat less effective than originally hoped, health officials said here ndrome _ had been largely people over 60, and often were those suffering from other health problems as well.
But eight people with the disease died here this weekend, and five of them were between ages 35 and 52 and did not have medical conditions that might have been contributing factors, said Dr.Liu Shao-haei, a senior manager of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.
Canada and Singapore each reported three more SARS-related deaths as well.
But Liu said at a news conference here Sunday that a combination of ribavarin and steroids, while helpful for many, had not improved the condition of some patients, whose health has continued to deteriorate even after they entered intensive-care units.
``Some of the patients respond well to treatment and some do not,'' he said.
Efforts to harvest serum from patients who have recovered from the disease and inject it into those still suffering, in the hope that the serum will contain antibodies, have run into safety problems, Liu said.
He declined to identify the safety problems, but he said serum was only being used on a limited and experimental basis while the problems were investigated.
The disclosures came as President Hu Jintao of China came to Shenzhen, the mainland Chinese city that abuts Hong Kong.
He met with Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive, and the leaders of Guangdong province, which includes Shenzhen, on how to curb the spread of SARS.
The government of Hong Kong, a fairly autonomous region of China since its handover by the British in 1997, said in a statement Sunday night that President Hu of China had ``pledged the full support of the central government'' in areas like the provision of protective gear for medical workers.
This can be dangerous because the respirators become heavily contaminated with viral particles and therefore dangerous to touch.
Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong's dominant carrier and Asia's fourth-largest airline, said Sunday it was carrying only a third of the passengers that it had a year ago, and had canceled 42 percent of its flights.
Two airline officials said over the weekend the airline might have to ground its fleet if`trffic declines further, but Rosita Ng, an airline spokeswoman, said Sunday night that there were no such plans.
Dr.Lam Ping-yan, Hong Kong's deputy director of health, acknowledged another problem at Sunday's news conference with Liu when he said that ``quite a number'' of people had been arriving in Hong Kknw"and immediately seeking medical care for SARS.
There had been scattered reports of SARS-infected people from mainland China entering hospitals here because Hong Kong has a better medical system.
But Lam did cite encouraging evidence that, as in mainland China, children here seem less affected by the disease than adults.
The World Health Organization said Friday that SARS had hit Hong Kong harder than anywhere else, for reasons that remain unclear.
Including 42 new cases reported Sunday, Hong Kong has three-fifths of the world's current SARS patients, with 887 patients still in hospitals while 40 have died and another 223 have recovered and been discharged from hospitals.
But there have been questions raised about the veracity of mainland China's figures.
China has reportwt fwinter, plus 60 who died.
There has also been some debate here over the Hong Kong government's use of a fairly narrow definition for who has SARS.
The government only counts people with pneumonia symptoms and does not count people who may have been exposed to SARS carriers and become somewhat ill but whom do not show pneumonia symptoms.
Liu, of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, said at the news conference on Sunday that Hong Kong believed its definitions were consistent with international standards.
REPORTED CASES OF VIRUS JUMP SHARPLY IN CHINESE PROVINCE
Reported cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome rose sharply on Monday in an interior province of northern China, heralding the possible spread of the disease through the country's vast, medically underserved hinterlands.
A report last week that 32 people in Shanxi province, a region of coal mines and factory towns, had been diagnosed with the disease, known as SARS, had already raised concerns among health experts.
The disease, which has been fatal in about 4 percent of cases, has been concentrated in the prosperous, urbanized southeastern province of Guangdong and in neighboring Hong Kong, with small numbers of cases appearing in other Chinese cities.
The worry deepened on Monday when the ministry of health, in its daily update to the World Health Organization, said 47 more cases had been reported from Shanxi on Sunday.
``We're very concerned about what may be happening out in the provinces,'' Henk Bekedan, director of the WHO office here, said in an interview.
The Shanxi cases are concentrated in the provincial capital of Taiyuan, where SARW gcs apparently introduced several weeks ago by a traveler returning from Guangdong.
The new figures bring reported cases in the Taiyuan area to 79.
This is a small number in a metropolitan region of 3.3 million, but it is more than double the 37 cases reported as of Monday here in Beijing, the capital, with a metropolitan area population of some 14 million.
Public fears are being expressed here that the government says are overblown.
Nationwide, China now has reported 1,418 cases of the disease, with 64 deaths, of a worldwide total of 3,619 cases and strong new concern about SARS and called for greater openness and stronger control measures.
He did not describe the disease as ``under effec4mvT"control'' _ as senior health officials had last week in an effort to reassure the public and head off the mass cancellation of foreign tourist and business visits to Chinan
Bekedan said the surge in Shanxi might reflect a natural second wave of infections, as the initial patients exposed others before they were diagnosed and isolated.
What happens next will depend on the effectiveness of control measures introduced by local officials.
Reached by telephone, officials at the national health ministry and the health departments of Shanxi province and Taiyuan city all declined to comment on the increasing caseload in Shanxi.
The ministry is to issue new national data on Tuesday.
Adding to the concern of health experts are the often substandard quality of health facilities and surveillance in much of interior China.
Millions of workers from the relatively prosperous coastal areas made trips home to these interior provinces during the lunar new year holidays in February _ just when the epidemic was reaching a peak in Guangdong.
``Our assumption is that most of China's provinces will have cases,'' Bekedan said on Monday.
Second to Shanxi in reported cases, among the inland provinces, is Inner Mongolia, which as of Sunday had reported 17.
Smaller numbers of cases have been detected in several other provinces, but the vast majority of victims are still in Guangdong, with more than 1,250 reported cases though a declining curve of new victims.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
But by the end of the fourth day of what is planned as a six-day mission, the investigators had still not gained access to any of the city's military hospitals, apparently because of foot-dragging by military administrators who are not under the health ministry's-hat the city's military hospitals alone might hold 100 SARS patients.
City and military officials have denied this.
But it appears unlikely that the team, in the short time planned for this visit, can allay public skepticism about the true extent of SARS in Beijing, especially because the government has so far refused to provide data on suspected cases and people who are quarantined for observation.
Scores or hundreds of people, some experts guess, may be in isolation in hospitals now, possibly helping to explain the rampant rumors and conflicting accounts.
Health experts are also worried by the coming May 1 holiday, when many Chinese normally take trips.
In recent years, the government has extended the holiday to a full week and encouraged travel in hopes of stimulating the economy.
The widespread movement of people, uspecse contact with sick people, including the inhalation of droplets from their coughs.
So far, no campaign has been mounted to discourage travel, even to and from the center of infection in Guangdong, or to require the screening of passengers for fever and other signs of illness.
In Hong Kong, health officials said on Monday night that there had been 40 more cases in the Chinese territory, and seven more deaths.
The number of deaths in Hong Kong has jumped lately, but Dr.Ko Wing-man, the acting chief executive of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, said at a news conference that it was unclear whether the mortality rate had risen or whether there were simply more patients infected with the disease.
SARS SPREADS WORRY IN CALIFORNIA
In her cramped herb and acupuncture shop in the heart of Chinatown, Emmelyn Chu proudly says she has cured everything from acne to colon cancer with her tiny needles and her concoctions of dried plants and roots.
But there's one disease she admits she can't cure.
It's the one on most people's minds here: SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.
``We don't even know (enough) about this one yet,'' Chu says in a combination of English and Chinese.
``I can't cure.
But I can prevent.''
Since it was recognized in Asia in February, SARS has spread to big cities and rural towns in 25 countries around the globe.
In the United States, no place has seen more suspected cases than California.
As of early Friday, health officials were tracking 47 cases in California, almost double the cases in the next-highest state, New York.
Ten of the California cases are in Los Angeles County.
Given California's close Asia ties, it's surprising there aren't more suspected cases of SARS in the state.
``When you look at the rate ...California really isn't far out of step with rest of the country,'' said Dr.Marc Romney, an epidemiologist with the California Department of Health Services.
Partly as a result, health officials here aren't doing much different than their peers in other states as they try to contain the disease.
Quarantine areas at airports in Los Angeles International and San Francisco have increased in importance after an American Airlines flight from Tokyo was detained and isolated in San Jose this month over SARS concerns that later proved to be false.
Pamphlets about the disease are printed and distributed in Asian languages in Asian communities.
The biggest impact from SARS has been to California's struggling economy.
California's airports are hubs for flights to Asia.
Its shipping ports handle the vast majority of the goods imported from and exported to Asia.
And its companies, from Silicon Valley tech firms to Southern California auto manufacturing plants, have more ties to Asian partners than most businesses elsewhere.
The pain has trickled down in the biggest state economy in the nation.
Companies such as Intel Corp.and Hewlett-Packard Co.are limiting tr#vel to Asian factories and suppliers that help make their goods.
Airlines such as Cathay Pacific and United Airlines, as a result, have cut flights.
Suppliers to those airlines and manufacturers have scaled down in turn, sometimes laying off workers.
The downturn has had a major impact on California's economy at a time when it was already suffering, says Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.
If the SARS outbreak and fears surrounding it continue to grow, it could prompt consumer fears that Asian goods might spread the disease _ something researchers say is unlikely.
``We've sort of already written off all the tourism and business travel from Asia,'' Kyser says.
``Now for other businesses, we're watching very carefully.
We've basically got our fingers crossed.''
Small businesses with an Asian flavor are being hurt as badly as big companies.
In San Francisco, where 30 percent of the population is Asian, restaurants have lost business on rumors that their employees were infected with SARS.
Tourism was already sufferinw12se isn't contained soon, visitors bureau officials say, it could deepen the impact on one of San Francisco's biggest industries.
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows.)
In places like Los Angeles' Chinatown, meanwhile, customers are flocking to shops like Emmelyn Chu's to get special combinations of herbs and other Chinese medicines that purportedly help prevent the disease, often bringing in recipes from doctors back in China.
Few here wear surgical masks like their friends and family in China and elsewhere, but patients line up five and six deep in some shops to wait and see herbalists.
Ginseng sales are better than usual.
For some here though, there's no debate.

ANALYSIS: DISEASE PUTS WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION TO THE TEST
The World Health Organization has said that SARS is over in Vietnam and waning in Hong Kong, and on Tuesday it said it would rescind the warning against travel to Toronto.
Responding to the first favorable news about severe acute respiratory syndrome since the U.N. agency issued a global health warning on March 12, the markets in Hong Kong are rebounding.
But the pronouncements raise questions about the degree of confidence anyone can have in making predictions about the course of a new disease _ a disease about which, as the WHO is the first to acknowledge, so little is known.
``We are sailing a boat while we are building it,'' Dr.Klaus Stoehr, the scientific director of the WHO's SARS investigation, said in an interview.
The WHO has no regulatory or police powers and trusts countries to report honestly to it.
Among other things, the teams also teach proper infection control in caring for patients in hospitals; obtain specimens from patients; and send the specimens to an international network of laboratories that the WHO has created for SARS.
But no one knows how fully the measures traditionally used for known diseases will apply to thIon Monday the WHO declared Vietnam the first country to have stopped its outbreak of SARS (though the agency cautioned that new importations might occur).
In so doing, it relied on a time-honored rule of thumb: An epidemic has ended if no new cases occur in a time span double the longest incubation period.
But among the many unknowns about SARS is for how long someone can transmit the SARS virus after becoming infected.
The WHO uses a 20-day period: twice the 10 days that is the longest known interval between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms.
Yet the incubation period may have been as long as 13 days in one case.
If 26 days turns out to be a more accurate time span for SARS, then the WHO will adjust accordingly, said Dr.David L. Heymann, who is in charge of communicable diseases for the WHO.
``We are applying what we know and going on what has been observed, although not everything may have been proved,'' Heymann said on Tuesday.
``It has worked so far, and we will adjust if the situation changes.''
Heymann doubts that many such cases have been missed.
``We have been investigating rumors of such cases every day,'' he said, ``and we have not had any cases that could not be traced back to a severe case.''
The biggest handicap is the lack of a reliable diagnostic test for SARS.
The WHO's actions have been generally applauded.
But it became embroiled in controversy last week when it added Canada to its list of areas that people without urgent business should avoid.
Heymann said the decision was based not on politics but three criteria that the agency has set to determine whether to include an area in a travel advisory.
One is the magnitude of the SARS epidemic in a country.
The WHO will list countries that have 60 or more active cases or that have an average of five or more new cases each day in the preceding three days.
Many SARS cases have occurred among health care workers, patients and visitors in hospitals.
So the WHO's second criterion is to list areas where there is community spread, defined as transmission outside of hospitals.
Third, countries are listed if they have exported cases elsewhere.
Heymann said Canada was being removed because it had not exported cases since April 3 and community transmission stopped on April 9.
``We should have issued the travel advisory for Canada a week earlier'' than the WHO did but did not because the agency could not obtain information it needed until after Easter, Heymann said.
``We are often asked why are we doing what we are doing, and the answer is we have no choice,'' Heymann said.
Dr.Alfred Sommer, dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said that ``if SARS remains endemic in only one country, the rest of the world will have to constantly guard'' against importations.
The biggest concern is that cases from China coUld0seed SARS through Asia, even Africa.
And the concern about China is the decline of the public health infrastructure over the last decade.
Many local doctors and health workers have moved to the cities and preventive services have suffered, Sommer said.
``The question is: Is SARS already endemic in China?'' said Heymann, who acknowledged that the WHO had not determined the criteria for declaring SARS endemic in a country.
It is not known whether SARS has a seasonal pattern like other infectious diseases and might appear in the Southern Hemisphere this winter.
``Let's not congratulate ourselves,'' Sommer said, ``if we believe the disease has come under control, if all it has done is gone into hiding because of seasonal changes,'' ready to strike again next winter.
IN VILLAGES, MUCH CONCERN AND LITTLE PREVENTION AGAINST SARS
Villagers like Wang Wenlan, who spends these days at home watching her twin grandsons, are accustomed to such neglect.
Nobody cares about us,'' she said.
``We have to take care of ourselves.''
Still, the village authorities allowed them back.
``We haven't let the kids play outside since,'' Wang said.
She said she wanted to buy some disinfectant, but the price was hiked too high.
The fqm)dy has no protective masks nor a thermometer.
She said the village had done nothing except hand out brochures and send a truck with a loudspeaker for a couple days last month to broadcast some announcements.
``We couldn't understand what she was saying,'' said Wang, sitting in the living room of her brick house under a large poster of Mao Zedong.
Preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China's under-equipped rural areas has become the government's top priority.
A front page commentary Friday in the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, said prevention of SARS in the countryside would determine the success or failure of China's struggle against the deadly disease.
Premier Wen Jiabao has promised free medical care for any rural resident diagnosed with SARS, which has infected nearly 5,000 people in China and killed more than 200.
Asked if he believed such promises, Wang's husband Cheng Guanglong replied: ``I believe the higher-ups, but when it comes to the lower level officials ...'' his voice trailed.
Corruption is almost a given in the countryside and confidence in the local government is low.
Getting China's vast rural population to cooperate and trust authorities will be crucial to containing SARS.
Many fled Beijing to their provincial hometowns in the last several weeks, some bringing the disease with them.
Local authorities are overwhelmed trying to identify and quarantine them.
The biggest victim of the mass exodus so far has been Hebei, a province of 67 million people which encircles Beijing.
More than 1 million workers and students have returned to Hebei, according to the state-run media.
It saw its first SARS case on April 19, and three weeks later, has 147 cases.
An expert team from the World Health Organization arrived in Hebei on Thursday on a five-day mission to investigate its prevention and control measures.
Villages outside Zhuozhou, a city in Hebei six miles from the Beijing border, were on high alert this week, with people at each village entrance stopping all visitors to take their temperature.
Workers returning from their jobs in Beijing are housed in a large tent for 14 days.
A local official said a number of cases have already been found.
When two foreign reporters arrived, Zhuozhou authorities were quick to react.
Despite the central government's self-proclaimed new policy of openness on SARS, the reporters were surrounded by police and escorted out of the province.
Breakneck growth along China's coastal areas has left its vast interior severely lagging in just about all aspects.
Its health care system has been especially neglected.
A government inspection team ly unprepared to deal with SARS.
The entire province has only 30 respirators and not a single hospital had suitable protective suits and goggles for medical staff, meaning an infected patient would likely cause a large outbreak among hospital workers, said the China Youth Daily.
Furthermore, although the central and provincial governments have allocated nearly $2 million, funding is still inadequate and local ic servants, the paper said.
Although Qinghai has not yet reported any ca;24:60 776 12060::2973:46294wYX[\Ye number of students and workers have already returned to the province and another 20,000 are expected in the coming days.
When market reforms started two decades ago, hospitals were made to rely increasingly on their own profits.
That left doctors open to bribes and hospitals were forced to make money by overcharging and overprescribing medicines and diagnostic tests.
Health care costs have grown by more than 400 percent in the last decade, said Ray Yip, a senior advisor to UNICEF in Beijing who has studied public health programs in China for five years.
Only 10 percent of peasants have any kind of health insurance.
Disease prevention has been an even lower priority than medical care.
China has more than 4,200 disease control offices with more than 200,000 staff, but funding is basically enough just to cover salaries, according to the official Southern Weekend newspaper.
There is little left for education, surveys or other investigations, it quoted a former health ministry official as saying.
Moreover, officials pay such little attention to disease prevention agencies, ``they are seen as a good place to put relatives and retirees,'' the paper quoted Jiang Qingwu, director of the school of public health at Shanghai's Fudan University, as saying.
Of Beijing's 5,000 staff at various disease control offices, not more than 50 have had official training and are qualified, said Hu Yonghua, director of Peking University's school of public health.
Two-thirds of the graduates of his school go to work overseas because the profession is so underpaid and undervalued in China, despite its desperate need for people with such training.
When it comes to health care, local governments prefer to spend funds on building hospitals or other facilities rather than on something invisible, such as a disease control network.
Still, the outlook is not completely bleak in China's countryside.
With a disease like SARS, prevention is still possible, making an inadequate health system less of an issue.
``You don't need high-tech equipment or skills.
You just need vigorous supervision and management,'' Yip said.
So I'm pretty confident in that regard.''

Scientists: New virus a potential epidemic
SARS could become a global epidemic if adequate control measures are not taken, two groups of scientists warned*Fr20 47074nfluential medical journal, but stringent control measures can stop the disease if deployed in time.
The papers, published on the Web site of the journal Science, appeared on a day of mixed news that underlined the continuing unpredictability of severe acute respiratory syndrome.
Five new SARS cases cropped up in a Toronto rehabilitation hospital, weeks after Canada's last case of SARS was recorded.
Two patients are in critical condition and one has tested positive for the virus that causes SARS, Ontario province health officials said.
Anyone who visited the hospital between May 9 and May 20 was asked to put themselves in home quarantine.
In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta renewed a travel alert for Toronto that it had dropped earlier this month, warning travelers to take extra precautions that include avoiding hospitals and practicing frequent handwashing.
Simultaneously, the World Health Organization dropped its long-standing advisory against travel to Hong Kong and Guangdong, China, the two hot spots for SARS in Asia.
There was no such good news for Taiwan, now the only place where SARS cases are known to be increasing.
The island nation reported an additional 55 cases overnight, bringing its total to 538 cases out of 8,117 worldwide.
Dr. Chesley L. Richards Jr., a CDC epidemiologist from Georgia who may have been infected with SARS while advising Taiwan on controlling its outbreak, boarded an air-ambulance flight in Taipei on Friday morning along with three CDC colleagues.
Richards wore protective gear _ gown, hair covering, mask and eye shield _ and walked onto the plane under his own power, the CDC said.
The plane, a Gulfstream small jet that normally holds up to 20 people, was expected in Atlanta on Friday evening or this morning, CDC spokesman Llelwyn Grant said.
All vour elowed to go home once they are checked by a CDC physician but will be monitored by the Georgia Division of Public Health.
Richards, an infection control expert who had been working in hospitals in Taipei, developed a low fever Monday, recovered, and then experienced a return of fever and cough on Thursday.
His condition did not change during the flight Friday, Grant said.
Richards will be placed in an isolation room _ a special hospital room rigged so that the air within it does not flow into the rest of the hospital _ and treated by employees in protective gear until his symptoms clarify, Grant said.
The CDC declined to say Friday in which Atlanta hospital Richards would be treated.
The agency has a long-standing but informal relationship with Emory University School of Medicine, which operates Emory University, Emory Crawford Long and Wesley Woods hospitals.
Emory University Hospital declined to say whether Richards would be treated there.
Both groups used mathematical models to predict possible spread of the disease.

WORLD MAY NOT HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF SARS VIRUS
The world may not have seen the last of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus.
There are concerns in the infectious-disease community that the recent outbreak was merely what some experts call a ``herald wave,'' and that the virus could come back with a vengeance for next winter's flu season.
Dr. Don Burke, a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, said ``if you accept the notion that a lot of respiratory viruses are seasonal, and decline with or without human intervention, you have to consider that when the environmental conditions permit, it could re-emerge.''
How will we know?
``Look very closely in the places it's persisting, like China,'' Burke said.
``Low-level transmission of mild SARS cases'' could still be going on in China today, he said.
``We need to use gene-amplification techniques to look for the SARS virus in respiratory secretions,'' Burke said.
``If there were only a few cases, that can be the final step to eradication.
If it's more serious, then we have a heads up for next season.''
``It's entirely possible that SARS is eradicated _ but if there were more than 10 active strains going on through the summer with minimal intervention and we did nothing, that's the worst possible outcome,'' he said.
``Wrmaceutical companies to develop tests to identify SARS,'' he said.
This cooperation paid big dividends when the United States combatted SARS.
``We coordinated on the state and local level and worked with non-traditional partners like the travel industry.''
``There's still so much unknown, and it's hard to predict when the next wave will be _ we need to have the proper mechanisms in place,'' he said.
``If it does come back, it may come back in a much worse epidemic than we had last year.
SARS didn't really take off until later on in the respiratory virus season,'' Burke said.
``If it had gotten started earlier and built up steam, the total impact could be much worse.''

MAJOR POWER FAILURE IN MUCH OF U.S. AND CANADA CAUSES DISRUPTIVE
A huge power failure swept through parts of the Northeast, Midwest and Canada on Thursday, causing blackouts, snarling t0affic, shutting down transportation systems and cellular phone networks and sending people pouring into the streets.
The series of blackouts began about 4 p.m. as lights, air-conditioning and transportation shut down in New York City and at least parts of New York state, northern New Jersey, Long Island and Connecticut.
There were also reports of wide power failures as far west as Detroit and as far north as Toronto and Ottawa.
In New York, Gov.George E. Pataki declared a state of emergency at 5:30 p.m. and deployed National Guard and the State Police to assist local authorities.
The cause of the power failure was still not clear late Thursday afternoon, but some information was available,
Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City said he had been told by upstate authorities that the power failures were due to an overload on the Niagara Mohawk Power Grid, which supplies power to much of the Northeast and, according to a senior New York Police Department official, includes five states.
An official at the New York Independent System Operator, the consortium that manages the state's power grid, said officials had been told that the trouble started with a fire at an upstate power plant.
But there were conflicting reports about whether the plant is in the region of the Central Hudson utility or in Niagara Mohawk's territory.
Independent Power Producers of New York, the association that includes most of the plant owners, said it did not know the cause of the power failure.
Phone calls to the New York Power Authority, Con Edison and Niagara Mohawk did not go through.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told Reuver}9273:4294::27;700+240;277472410:477:40::42924907 :299794964 7;76;22:4217664994779987529607!9 07&2299aid.
The blackout created instant problems for transportation coordinators.
There were initial reports that airports were closed across much of the East late Thursday afternoon, and that controllers were busy rerouting flights.
The Homeland Security Department said it had received no requests for assistance from officials in communities affected by the blackout _ an indication that local government and emergency agencies were not overwhelmed.
On an afternoon that was hot and hazy across much of the East and Midwest, the blackout caused tens of thousands of people to pour into the streets in New York City.
Inbscenes no doubt repeated throughout the affected area, the city's wide avenues turned into rivers of pedestrians as people swarmed through gnarled traffic in streets devoid of traffic signals.
Calm largely appeared to prevail, though so did bewilderment and tension.
Many were at a loss as to how they were going to get home.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
``Right now the power outage is affecting all of our operations,'' a spokesman for the New York Port Authority told Reuters shortly after the blackout hit.
``We have no buses, no trains, no subways running.
'' But a couple of hours later, the Port Authority said buses were again beginning to run from its West Side terminal, offering hope of a hooeknming for thousands of commuters in New Jersey.
But for rail commuters headed to Long Island, propsects were dimmer.
A Long Island Railroad train was reported stranded under the East River.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
Regulators said the country's air traffic had been unaffected.
But finding a way home despite a near-total shutdown of the city's public transportation system was only one concern.
Another concern was terrorism, especially in New York, a city still feeling the effects and showing the scars of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
But officials at all levels of government said there were no signs that the blackout had been the work of terrorists.
There were no immediate reports of panic or looting.
Some public buildings were operating on emergency generators.
A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange said the facility had lost no data from the power failure and that it would resume trading on Friday, under emergency power if necessary.
Thursday afternoon's series of failures recalled those of July 1977, when New York City was plunged into blackness on a sweltering summer evening, and November 1965, when a domino-effect string of power failures darkened lights, trapped people in elevators, stranded commuters and halted the engines of transportation across much of the East.
As Thursday afternoon wore on, a huge parade of people streamed across the Brooklyn Bridge, reminiscent of the exodus from Lower Manhattan following the Sept. 11 attacks.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
Lines formed outside pay telephones as cell phones fell silent.
A man who managed to get a cell phone signal worried aloud into the phone about the potential for melting ice and rotting meat.
Marjorie Mitchell, 26, a bank worker in lower Manhattan who lives in White Plains, N.Y., said: ``I don't know how I am going to get home.
The trains are dead.
My cell is dead.
Lights flickered and dimmed in Albany, the New York state capital, a few minutes past 4 p.m., causing computers to shut d-wn in governpublic buildings at 5:13 p.m., telling all nonessential employees to exit with calm and make their way home.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM)
At least three cities on the shore of Lake Erie _ Toledo, Cleveland and Erie, Pa._ were among those hit.
Erie is the hometown of Tom Ridge, the secretary of Homeland Security.
Last year legilators rejected measures that would have provided money to update the nation's power grids.
Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico and a former energy secretary in the Clinton administration, told reporters on Thursday, ``We're a superpower with a third world grid.''
He added, ``We have not imposed harsh reliability standards on utlitities.''
President Bush was in Southern California on Thursday for a fundraising and had not commented as of early evening.
MILLIONS REMAIN WIHTOUT POWER IN NORTHEAST FOR SECOND DAY
Millions of people in the Northeast, the Midwest and Canada remained without electricity for a second day on Friday as utilities struggled to recover from a blackout that spread its shadow over eight states and played havoc with everything from traffic lights and telephones to manufacturing schedules at automobile plants.
Lights _ and, on a sweltering summer day, air-conditioners and fans _ went on again in the most populous corner of the nation, prompting cheers.
In New York City, the power had returned to about 85 percent of all customers by Friday evening.
But electricity was restored piecemeal, sometimes on one side of a street but not the other, as officials tried to avoid overloading the power-sharing system and triggering another collapse like the chain reaction set off on Thursday.
The effects of the power failure, the largest in U.S. history, remained worst on Friday in Midwestern cities including Detroit and Cleveland, which faced the possibility of an entire weekend without power.
Those two cities were also coping with a drinking-water crisis because the blackout hobbled stations that pump water from the Great Lakes to millions of homes and businesses.
Gov.Bob Taft of Ohio ordered National Guard tanker trucks to distribute thousands of gallons of emergency drinking water in Cleveland.
In New York, Broadway lights, and shows, went on.
The stock markets opened, and the New York Mets played their scheduled game against the Colorado Rockies.
But the subway system remained idle.
Hospitals struggled to treat patients suffering from heat-related ailments and anxiety, and many telephones, automated teller machines and cable-television systems were still out of order.
Trash piled up on city streets alongside stranded tourists who camped out in parks and outside hotels and train stations.
At least four deaths, two in New York City and two in Canada, were attributed to the power failure, as well as numerous fires traced to the candles many used overnight.
Many offices, stores and factories closed for the day, and hundreds of flights were canceled.
``We will respond,'' he said during a trip to California.
``We will figure out what wton to the state capitals demanded investigations and assurances that something would be done to prevent another power failure on so large a scale.
Govs.George E. Pataki of New York, James E.McGreevey of New Jersey and John G. Rowland of Connecticut wrote to the Secretary of Energy, Spencer Abraham, saying that similar promises had been made after blackouts in 1965 and 1977.
``We have to have answers.''
Power officials said on Friday that the blackout began shortly after 4 p.m. on Thursday with a power failure somewhere in the Midwest _ a surge of electricity that pushed"ifuo Ontario, Canada, then into New York state and New England, tripping circuit breakers designed to prevent an overload by knocking generators out of service.
But they had no expLanqtion for the size and scope of the blackout.
Nor could they explain why it did not spread south from North Jersey into the Middle Atlantic states, or why systems designed to confine problems to relatively small areas suddenly failed.
In all, about 100 power plants shut down in about nine seconds, cutting off electricity to tens of millions of people.
Even as many of those generators were going back into service on Friday, officials urged consumers to go easy on the appliances and to use only those that were necessary.
And there were scattered new problems: In Connecticut, a transmission line to the southwestern corner of the state failed.
Officials who oversee the power-sharing system ordered rolling blackouts _ cutting power for several hours in several places, including the Cleveland area, Westchester County and upstate New York _ to allow more utilities to ease back onto the grid without causing fresh Disbuptions.
Air traffic remained chaotic, with airlines canceling about 400 flights bound for cities from New York to Ottawa.
And there were long lines at service stations in Detroit and in Manhattan, among other places, because the electric-powered pumps would not work.
Supplies ran short and tempers boiled.
``There've been a few fights,'' said Mohammad Khan, who works at a station on West 96th Street near West End Avenue.
Among the officials who oversee the power network that failed on Thursday, there was some0d){agreement on Friday about exactly where the problem had started.
New York state officials said they believed that the sudden voltage fluctuation that triggered the dominolike shutdown began at the Perry nuclear reactor near Cleveland.
But the operators of that plant said other transmission lines had shut down before theirs, suggesting that Perry was not the source of the problem.
That state's governor, Gov.Jennifer M. Granholm, declared a state of emergency in five counties on Friday.
She also signed an executive(oR`er intended to speed the delivery of nearly a million gallons of gasoline from western Michigan to the Detroit area.
Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick of Detroit urged elderly people who live in public housing to seek temporary shelter in designated ``cooling centers'' around the city.
Pataki, who declared a state gfamergency on Thursday, also asked the president to declare a federal emergency in New York state.
He and New York's two U.S. senators asked for federal money to cover the costs of emergency services.
New York City mobilized 10,000 police officers, five times the normal contingent, on Thursday, Sen.Charles E. Schumer said.
``I think it's safe to say said.
Complicating the estimates of lost productivity is uncertainty about how soon some factories could be restarted.
That, in turn, reflects the time needed to get power plants going again.
Pataki noted that it takes 24 hours to restart nuclear plants like Indian Point, which provide a critical part of the electricity for the lower part of New York state.
Although he urged people not to use too much power until the system had had time to stabilize, he said that he had requested and received federal approval to use the Long Island-Cross Sound Cable, which runs under the water between New York and Connecticut and has drawn local opposition.
He described the step as temporary and said it would provide additional emergency power for New York City and Long Island.
In New York, a 17-year-old youth fell to his death from a roof after trying to loot a Brooklyn shoe store, the police said.
One person died of a heart attack during one of the 60 serious fires reported on Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.
A firefighter and a police officer were also injured in the fires, he said.
The mayor said the 911 system had handled 90,000 calls, with 5,000 requiring emergency medical personnel.
The police said they arrested 50 to 60 people on burglary charges related to looting.
But the 250 blackout-related arrests overnight were nowhere near the number during the 1977 blackout, Bloomberg pointed out.
And even the total number of arrests overnight, 850 in all, was less than the average of 950 on most nights.
Consolidated Edison said it had no specific timetable for when electric service would be fully restored.
For New York City, the slow restoration was a result of a basic fact: The city needs its local plants operating, as well as the tie lines from outside the region that deliver power that generated hundreds of miles away.
'' He said the utility's equipment had suffered no damage, and the company had restored service as rapidly as was prudent.
``The extra hour here and there resulting from extra precautions is probably a good thing,'' the mayor said.
Progress was slower in Michigan, where officials of the local utility, DTE Energy, said that service had been restored to slightly more than half of its 2.1 million customers in southeastern Michigan.
In Ohio, about 1.4 million customers lost power when the blackout hit.
Utility officials in Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, said that by Friday night, most of them had electricity again.
But Cleveland's water-pumping problems led Taft to issue an order to boil drinking water.
The water problems sparked a run on bottled water at supermarkets.
The boil-water order covers Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, and will be in effect through Sunday.
Detroit residents were also warned to boil water before drinking.
Efforts to restore power in the Canadian province of Ontario continued.
Premier Ernie Eves declared a state of emergency and told nonemergency workers to stay home.
The police in Ottawa arrested 23 people for looting and reported two deaths possibly related to the blackout.
As power was rworking again.
For tourists who had slept on the sidewalks on Thursday, that meant they could go to phukr hotel rooms.
For more than 100 miners at a nickel mine in Falconbridge, 200 miles north of Toronto, that meant they could go home.
The AssociatEdPress reported that they had been trapped below ground for more than 12 hours because the blackout halted the elevators they use to go to the surface.
'ERIE LOOP' BLAMED AS WORST BLACKOUT FADES AWAY
Subways rumbled beneath Manhattan, the Indians played baseball in Cleveland and the ferris wheel rotated at the Michigan State Fair in Detroit as the worst blackout in the nation's history ended Saturday.
They continued to explore why the blackout spread within seconds to U.S. and Canadian cities from western Michigan to Massachusetts.
``We are fairly certain'' that the problem started in Ohio, said Michehl(cq) Gent, head of the North American Electric Reliability Council.
``We are now trying to determine why the situation was not brought under control.''
``We've got to quickly get to the bottom of the questions of what happened, how it spread and what to do to keep it from happening again,'' said Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham.
He said a joint U.S.-Canadian task force has already begun its probe.
Abraham met with New York Gov.George Pataki and New Jersey Gov.Jim McGreevey in Albany, N.Y.
Abraham said he would meet Thursday in Detroit with the Canadian minister of natural resources.
``Minister (Herb) Dhaliwal and I will start working immediately to find out what caused this massive blackout and to keep it from happening again,'' Abraham said.
``Reliable electric power is the lifeblood of the economy for both our countries.``
In the Midwest, residents of Cleveland and Detroit had electric power but wereth threats caused with the blackout shut off water system pumps.
Cleveland's power was fully restored Friday, in time for both baseball's Cleveland Indians inD$the NFL's Browns to play at home.
People in Detroit continued to experience low water pressure, but power was restored to nearly all of Michigan's 2.3 million customers Saturday.
Problems also cgnTinued in Canada.
``It is not going to be an abundance of power on Monday morning,'' Ontario Premier Ernie Eves said.
In Toronto, it was unclear if subway service would be restored in time for the new work week on Monday.
The New York area's three major airports were still a trouble spotSaturday as they adjusted for the several hundred flights canceledFriday.
But mostly, New Yorkers focused on getting their lives back in order.
The sidewalks, stores and parks were full of folks ready to forget their recent misery.
At a bustling Grand Central Terminal, the famed gold clock was ticking away Saturday after being stopped at 4:09 when the power was cut off on Thursday afternoon.
Rhdars rejoiced that the subway schedule was back on track.
``It usually gets me where I'm going.
When I get around, its either by my feet or the subway or, when I'm really tired, maybe a taxi,'' said Tim Shamey, who lives in the East Village and wore a black T-shirt bearing a picture of a subway token.
``I always travel by train,'' said Penny Vitolo.
``I came in for lunch on Thursday and was at a friend's apartment in lower Manhattan.
We were finishing a glass of wine when the power went out.''
After just getting home Friday night to Rowayton, Conn., she was back at Grand Central the following morning on the way to a wedding.
The subway is vital, said Andrew Bartsch, 15, who is too young to drive and lives in Westchester County.
``I go to Times Square a lot and use it to see friends in the city.
My dad couldn't get here to work for two days.''
When the power was lost, more than 400 subway trains and tens of thousands of riders had been stranded underground.
While the subway was running to Coney Island, the ocean was off-limits for swimming there and at all the other New York beaches because of contamination fears.
The blackout caused two sewage treatment plants to malfunction and dump tons of raw sewage into the salt water.
With subways running, free rides on buses ended.
Garbage workers collected overtime pay as well as the plastic bags of trash piled on the sidewalks.
Odors were ripe because tons of spoiling food had been thrown out as residents and restaurants were forced to empty their refrigerators and freezers.
The rule of thumb about whether food had gone bad, said Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is ``when in doubt, throw it out.''
At his news conference, Pataki said that although the subways are running, ``We cannot say with 100 percent certainty that this can't happen again until we know what happened and what steps are being taken to prevent it from happening again.''

FAILURE OF A LINE LED TO BLACKOUT, AN ANALYSIS SAYS
When an electrical transmission line sagged into a tree just outside Cleveland at 3:32 p.m. on Aug. 14, the events that would lead to the greatest power failure in North American history began their furious avalanche, according to the most extensive analysis of the blackout yet.
The failure of that transmission line was crucial, because it put enormous strain on other lines in Ohio.
Soon, the utility that serves southern Ohio, with its overloaded lines close to burning up, sealed itself off, creating in very real terms, an electrical barrier between southern and northern Ohio.
What happened next, by this account, was almost inevitable: To the north, Cleveland, starving for electricity, began to drain huge, unsustainable amounts of power from Michigan and then Ontario, knocking out more lines and power plants and pushing the crisis to the borders of northwestern New York.
First the New York system, acting to proteproblem: New York power plants, without anywhere to quickly send electricity not needed within the state, overloaded their own system.
That in turn quickly led to a general shutdown _ the last stage in the largest blackout in the nation's history.
That picture, based on large amounts of data from the utilities involved, was presented on Friday by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a private energy consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass.
Two researchers at Cambridge Energy, Hoff Stauffer and Lawrence Makovich, presented their analysis at a conference as federal energy officials, other industry representatives and reporters participated by telephone and on the Web.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was represented by Pat Wood III.
Wood would not comment on whether he thought the specifics of the theory were correct.
When problems soar around the grid in seconds, as they did that day, Wood said, ``you need to make sure that the communication between the different regions can move similarly fast.''
Ellen P. Vancko, a spokeswoman for the industry group charged with preventing grid problems, the North American Electric Reliability Council, said the group had not seen the scenario and could not comment.
That assessment was echoed by the organization that carries out day-to-day management of the grid in New York.
He said a federal investigation just begun by the Department of Energy would give definitive answers.
``Our position is that the facts will come out,'' he said.
``Eventually it will all be there.''
In the days since power went off in eight states and southern Ontario and left tens of millions of people without lights and other necessities, some of the companies involved have made public their partial timelines of events and sometimes their theories about what led to what.
This attempts to say what really happened _ where it started and why it progressed.''
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
The scenario also meshed with data released on Friday by American Electric Power, the southern Ohio utility that sealed itself off from the develop enormous flows in wires headed toward its region of Ohio.
Beyond that, American Energy officials said they would not discuss theories about the cause of the blackout.
But they did insist that they had been in extensive contact with officials with FirstEnergy, the utility whose lines were failing to the north, during roughly an hour of escalating trouble.
They did not describe the substance of that communication.
The prologue to the blackout occurred with problems that on a normal day would have been handled as part of the routine of moving electricity on the grid.
At 2 in the afternoon, one generator shut down at a power plant east of Cleveland that is operated by FirstEnergy.
About a half-hour later, American Electric says, it started detecting unusual activity in shared lines, events that led it to contact control rooms in the region.
From then on it was just a matter of where it would be.
Normally, procedures would have delayed sales of power or diverted them through other lines.
But those actions can require a half hour or more, according to various utility officials, and there was only about another half-hour to go before the troubles hurtled through the system.
But the severing of the two crucial Ohio lines was the equivalent of suddenly damming an onrushing stream: The flow had to divert to find a way to reach the Cleveland area.
The power did that by spilling around the barrier into Indiana, then into Michigan and finally back to Ohi/.
+
Within a few seconds, the modest amounts of power, around 200 megawatts, that was flowing from a utility in lower Michigan called the International Transmission Co., or ITC, soared to 10 times that amount.
At about the same time, the power that had been flowing from ITC to Ontario suddenly reversed, pouring still more electricity onto that part of the grid, while another Michigan utility began supplying power to the very same area in an effort to meet the demand.
The chain of events overwhelmed lines and power plants on the ITC system, and they all began shutting down.
By a little after 4:10, most of the system was out of service.
Shortly thereafter, the rapidly changing flows in Ontario created alerts or shutdowns of some kind in New York, though the details remain unclear, and the state sealed its border with Canada, according to the Cambridge Energy analysis.
One oddity in Cambridge Energy's reconstruction lies in its theory that it was the relatively low demand for power in New York state on Aug. 14 contributed to the last episode of the blackout.
In the past, of course, it has been the great demand for"pgver in New York that has produced problems.
As it happened that day, because the state had relatively light internal demands, it was exporting lots of power to Ontarin.
$But when the border was sealed, Cambridge Energy says, that large flow of power had nowhere to go and it sparked the abrupt New York shutdown.

(UNDATED) The recent massive blackout has recharged a debate about the wisdom of a trend among federal and state politicians to loosen the tightly regulated system that governed the electricity business in America for much of the 20th century.
Critics of federal and state laws that have partly deregulated the electricity industry say the changes have made power failures more likely because they replaced a system of closely regulated local power monopolies with a more complex, freewheeling system that emphasizes profits at the expense of maintenance.
Under the old system, local utilities ran all aspects of the electricity business _ producing, transmitting and distributing power _ but government regulators closely supervised their practices and profits.
The new laws, passed partly in response to complaints about rising ejebey costs from large U.S. companies, for the first time allowed competition among companies that produce electricity _ a move designed to lower prices.
Under deregulation, any company that produces electricity must be given access to transmission lines that once were reserved for monopolies.
``You hear people arguing that government wastes, government's inefficient.
``It's a very complex picture and it will take thousands of hours of data analysis ...to reconstruct.''
Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group of investor-owned utilities, said he's not sure why investment in transmission has not kept pace with the growing demand for electricity.
``We estimate that we're spending roughly $3 billion a year to maintain and upgrade the transmission infrastructure,'' he said.
``The jury's still out,'' McCarthy said, referring to the specific cause of the power failure.
Some supporters of der3360:47790 :42160157::6434:40;21een averted if the government had gone further and deregulated transmission.
(OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
Alan Schriber, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, said that even after deregulation, utility companies have been required to maintain the same service standards as before.
``One criticism you hear is that since deregulation, they've cut costs, or increased profits by lowering costs,'' he said.
``But for years and years and years, utilities have cut costs.
They only had a rate case (in which they could ask to increase utility bills) every 10 years.
So they were always cutting costs.''
``If the company`trHes to increase transmission, it can't increase rates to pay for it.
In some sense, the rate freeze is a perverse disincentive,'' Brown said.

MIDWEST GRID CONSORTIUM HAD EARLY TROUBLE FIGURING OUT PROBLEM,
An important element in the blackout of Aug. 14 may have been the inability of the the consortium that controls the Midwest regional grid to learn for 64 minutes prior to the system's collapse about transmission line failures in Ohi and to adjust the system to compensate, the head of a Michigan electric company testified on Thursday.
But, the official added that the pace of events after the system began experiencing trouble made response difficult and that until the last few minutes, the line failures did not seem to be overloading the system.
In the second day of hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Joseph L. Welch, chairman and chief executive of the International Transmission Co., said that his company's review of the records of a computerized regional system called the System Data Exchange, turned up nothing about the failure of seven separate transmission lines, most in the territory of FirstEnergy, in Ohio.
Utilities are supposed to report all failures to the System Data Exchange.
The president of the MISO, James P. Torgeson, did not address the issue directly but testified that in the minutes before the blackout, his dispatchers were speaking to FirstEnergy and trying to establish what was happening.
``We were seeing some things, and we were trying to confirm it with them what was going on, and we weren't getting the confirmation immediately,'' he said.
When a transmission line or a generating station goes out of service, flows of power on the grid shift, in ways that can cause overloads elsewhere in the system.
The change in electrical flows can also leave the system vulnerable to overload or collapse if one additional line or generating station fails.
Thus, said Welch, every time the system configuration changes, system dispatchers are supposed to recalculate the flows, and recalculate whether, in the system's new flow pattern, a single failure could cause a blackout.
``Every line on the transmission grid is supposed to be accounted for,'' he said.
But Torgeson, speaking to reporters after his testimony, said that his organization had not found any changes necessary until ``right before things broke apart.
'' And a spokeswoman for MISO pointed out that in the patchwork system of management and ownership of transmission lines, not all of the lines that failed were in MISO's territory.
Also on Thursday, FirstEnergy's top officials sought to cast doubt on the idea that they were at the center of the blackout.
Charles E.``Chuck'' Jones senior vice president of energy delivery and customer service at FirstEnergy said in a telephone interview that if the ``epicenter'' of the event was northern Ohio, then systems in that region would have been expected to fail.
But, he said, the neighboring systems, including American Electric Power, Dusquesne Light, and the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland independent system operator, were not seriously affected, and that three-quarters of FirstEnergy's own customers were not affezation of the power transmission entities.
The council's president, Michehl Gent, said soon after the blackout that it appeared to originate with failures of power lines in FirstEnergy's system.
For two days, the House committee has held extended discussions about the difficulties of expanding the capacity of the transmission grid, but by most accounts, the grid does not appear to have been under any particular strain until very shortly before the lights went out.
And while many witnesses said they would prefer a stronger grid, Eugene R.McGrath, the chairman of Consolidated Edison, added that the system was usually less expensive and more reliable if the generating stations were close to the load centers.
New York state, seeking to increase reliability, requires that 80 percent of the New York City load be generated within the five boroughs.
McGrath and others asked that any national system of mandatory transmission rules allow local jurisdictions to augment those rules with even stricter requirements.
OHIO UTILITY'S ERRORS BLAMED FOR HISTORIC BLACKOUT
``This blackout was largely preventable,'' Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said a news conference.
``However, once the problem grew to a certain magnitude, nothing could have been done to trevent it from cascading out of control.''
The task force said FirstEnergy violated four reliability standards set by the power industry.
It found that the initial cause of the blackout was three power lines that short-circuited Aug. 14 after heat caused them to sag into trees that First Energy had not trimmed.
Because computer monitoring systems at FirstEnergy were not working properly, operators at the plant didn't know about the downed lines until half an hour after the third line failed.
The instability in Ohio escalated into a surge in power demand that shut down more than 263 power plants in seven minutes, affecting 50 million customers in eight U.S. states and Canada.
Many customers were without power for days, and some places in Ontario experienced rolling blackouts for about a week.
Economic losses are estimated at $6 billion.
The task force's 134-page interim report also found that the Midwest Independent System Operator in Indiana, which oversees the region's power grid, also violated a reliability standard by using outdated data, preventing it from recognizing transmission problems developing in the region.
The reliability standards violated by FirstEnergy and the grid's overseers are voluntary measures set by the power industry, which is largely self-regulating.
Violations of the standards are not punishable by fines, and the task force said the utility broke no federal rules in the incident.
Enforceable reliability standards, such as those in the energy bill currently before the Senate, would help prevent future blackouts, said Abraham.
The company's lower levels of reactive power made the lines sag more than usual that day, said Joe Mosbrook, a spokesman for the nation's fourth largest investor-owned utility company.
While the report cited FirstEnergy for failing to maintain tree growth, Mosbrook said that the company is on a five-year tree trimming cycle, the industry standard.
He blamed the mountil the blackout.
Rep.Ed Markey, D-Mass., called the report ``a blistering indictment of management and operational failures at FirstEnergy'' and said the company ``should take immediate steps to replace its entire senior management.''
The interim report is only the first step in the joint international task force's job.
It will open up the report to comment in cities affected by the blackout and issue a final report next year.

BLACKOUT ANNIVERSARY: LIGHTS ARE ON BUT NOT MUCH ELSE HAS CHANGED
When a major power line goes dead in New York state, its ghost appears in Guilderland, N.Y.
At the control center of the New York Independent System Operator, specialists oversee the state's power transmission system.
A two-story-high schematic diagram covers one side of the room, with New York's major power pathways represented by multicolored lines.
A dysfunctional line turns into a string of colored lights.
During a recent visit, only a couple of lines were lit.
There was little to be concerned about.
On Aug. 14, 2003, however, the whole board was aglow.
That summer day, a power line in Ohio drooped into a tree, triggering a blackout that rapidly blanketed most of New York, Ontario, eastern Michigan and northern Ohio, and parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut and Vermont.
The blackout left an estimated 50 million people without power, and cost an estimated $4 billion to $10 billion in the United States.
Today, the cause of the blackout is known: mistakes and conditions that caused a cascading surge of power to sweep through the complex electric grid, prompting transmission lines and generators to shut down.
But a year later, many in the industry say that if the same thing were to happen, New York and other areas in the affected region still might be left in the dark.
"Could we withstand exactly the same thing that happened last year?" William Museler, president and chief executive of NYISO, said.
"Maybe, maybe not."
While some specific problems have been corrected, the larger situation that allowed the blackout to take place still exists, several experts said.
One of the reasons the blackout spread was that problems in the Midwest went unfixed.
Standards for running the transmission system in New York are generally agreed to be the best in the country.
But as the nation's power grid becomes increasingly interconnected and interdependent, a glitch across a border can have a big impact across the system.
"We are as strong as the weakest link in this whole interconnection of energy systems," said New York state Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Democrat who chairs the assembly's energy committee.
Yet federal legislation to make standards mandatory and enforceable has stalled.
The transmission system is not robust enough to withstand major power swings, because over the years the amount the country has spent on the network has declined.
Meanwhile, demand for power has grown with the population and the proliferation of power-hungry technology.
"The bottom line is, we're going to have another failure.
I don't know when, but we will."
There is a big focus on what's called "vegetation management," to make sure trees and plants don't interfere with electrical systems, he said.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, an industry reliability group based in New Jersey, has been conducting readiness audits of regional transmission controllers.
One of the problems last summer was a lack of communication among different transmission regions.
For example, NYISO had no idea what its counterpart, the Midwest Independent System Operator, was doing.
Today, NYISO and MISO have direct lines of communication, NYISO's Museler said.
And operators here have access to data from a larger area of the grid -- they can see beyond the boundaries of New York state, which lets them know about disruptions coming down the pike.
When the power line in Ohio touched a tree and cut out, the electricity began to flow through other lines, which in turn shut down from overload -- a pattern that would repeat again and again.
"It should have been a very localized problem," said Ralph Fehr, an electrical engineering professor at the University of South Florida and a power systems expert.
The line was maintained by Akron, Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
The U.S.-Canada Power System Outage Task Force, created by President Bush and former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien to investigate the blackout, found that, among many other problems, the company lacked emergency blackout plans.
The North American Electric Reliability Council found that FirstEnergy and other institutions violated several of the council's reliability standards, but there are no penalties for that.
The massive energy bills that have been proposed -- and stuck -- inCongress for the past few years have included provisions that would give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission power to enforce national standards.
The comprehensive bill, which encompassed ethanol subsidies and liability protections for makers of the fuel additive MTBE, passed the House last year but was filibustered, mostly by Democrats, in the Senate.
Some people mistakenly believe that the blackout was about not having enough electricity.
But on the day of the blackout, New York had enough extra generating capacity to power about 3 million homes.
Instead, it was partly about not having extra room to handle the power fluctuations that started in the Midwest.
Reducing the amount of demand can help buy time.
But the amount of power used in New York, for instance, has climbed each year, according to NYISO.
"Any given blackout is caused by a trigger," he said.
"A squirrel crawling into a transformer and getting fried.
A tree."
"You can't control all the squirrels."
EXPERTS ASSESS DEREGULATION AS FACTOR IN '03 BLACKOUT
Twenty-five months after a blackout darkened cities from New York to Toronto and Detroit, the U.S. Energy Department and its Canadian counterpart held their first public technical discussion on the episode Thursday to talk about one factor widely considered to have been behind it: the deregulation of the electric system.
"Markets allocate risk, they allocate capital, they provide price signals.
Markets do not have a conscience, they do not provide social policy, and they do not do things they are not paid to do."
For example, participants at the meeting said, utilities that once ran the system sometimes added transmission lines to increase reliability of electric power.
When they did so, their costs would be reimbursed through the regulatory process; now there is less incentive to take on such efforts, and several participants pointed out that in fact investment in transmission had lagged.
The blackout of 2003 began on Aug. 14 and in some places lasted more than two days.
A binational report issued three months afterward did not list deregulation as a cause, instead citing factors like failure to trim trees, train operators and install control systems that could have kept track of the status of all power lines and generators.
Much of the investigation leading to that report was managed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the architect of utility restructuring in the United States.
The report called for a separate study -- it did not say by whom -- on the role of deregulation in the blackout, but that study has never been done.
One member of the panel, Jack Casazza, a 60-year veteran of the industry, said the changes had brought lawyers and MBA's to the head of these competitive companies, rather than engineers.
Others pointed out that information like a power plant's maximum capacity, and its state of repair on any given day, was now considered proprietary and so was not readily available to system operators, which manage regional power grids.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, whose members come from utilities, marketers, customers and federal agencies, said in a paper submitted for the meeting that the increased demands that deregulation's wider trading had placed on the transmission system "require the grid to be operated closer to its reliability limits more of the time than was the case in the past."
That requires better training and control equipment, said the group, which was founded after a vast blackout in the Northeast in 1965.
Still, not all the industry's changes have affected reliability adversely, participants said.
The energy bill signed into law by President Bush on Aug. 8 provides a mechanism for creating mandatory reliability rules.
The legislation allows the federal government to designate a private group, probably the North American Electric Reliability Council, as an official "electric reliability organization," with authority to set the rules.
But that group pointed out in its paper that while the designated organization would assess the adequacy of the system, it would not have the authority to require anybody to build a generating station or a transmission line.
MADRID SIGNALS TO EUROPE TERROR THREATS ON NEW SCALE
This weekend, many Europeans suddenly confronted the prospect that full-scale attacks by Islamic terrorists were no longer somebody else's problem, as they might have thought, but an immediate and mortal threat.
After Sept. 11, 2001, and especially during the fierce debates leading up to the Iraq war, many analysts say that the Europeans, though deeply sympathetic to the Americans after Sept. 11, did not really believe they faced the same danger.
But now after the bombings Thursday in Madrid that killed 200 people and injured 1,500, it seems likely that the differences will narrow, perhaps substantially, if Islamic extremists are found to be responsible.
If so, Europeans will also watch how politics plays out, both among th-from-behind victory of Spain's Socialist Party in the elections on Sunday may be a first sign of that.
The bombings in Madrid may bring a renewed sense of unity within the Western alliance.
Reports that al-Qaida bore responsibility, inconclusive as they were, overshadowed the final days of the campaign.
But other factors could be at work, including widespread discontent with the government's handling of the crisis, including what seems now a too-hasty effort to blame Basque separatists and to rule out the possibility of Islamic responsibility.
Meanwhile, Europeans were assessing how different their world looks from before the simultaneous bomb attacks in Madrid on Thursday.
The German government conducted an emergency meeting on Sunday of its security Cabinet, which includes Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, several Cabinet ministers and senior security and police officials.
Afterward, the interior minister, Otto Schily, said Germany was asking for an emergency gathering of European interior ministers and their police and security chiefs to form what he called a ``common assessment'' of the terrorism danger and to ``coordinate how to respond.''
Schily spoke of ``a new quality of threat from Islamic terrorism in Europe'' if Muslims are found to be responsible in Madrid.
Europeans are not strangers to terrorism, having experienced it many times in past decades, perpetrated both by homegrown radicals, like the Italian Red Brigades or the German Red Army Faction, as well as by Middle East extremists.
But the sort of mass attacks on civilian targets seen by security experts as a new threat, larger in scale and more religiously inspired than previous terrorism, did not strike Europe with full force until last Thursday.
Italy, like Spain, was among the strongest supporters of the Iraqi invasion, and both countries have contributed troops to the postwar occupation.
Indeed, 19 Italians were killed in Nasiriyah, Iraq, last November in an attack that U.S. officials have attributed to al-Qaida.
If Islamic groups did cause the bombings in Madrid, Olimpio said, Yt!dians could put more pressure on their prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, to withdraw the Italian contingent.
SPANISH POLICE NAME PLANNER OF BOMBINGS
By DALE FUCHS
c.2004 New York Times News Service
MADRID - Investigators have identified a Tunisian man as the leader of the March 11 bomb attacks on commuter trains in Madrid, and a judge has issued arrest warrants for him and five Moroccans for murder, according to court documents released Thursday.
A Spanish High Court judge, Juan del Olmo, issued a European arrest warrant for Sarhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet as the ``leader and coordinator'' of the bombings that killed 191 people and injured more than 1,400.
The warrant said Fakhet ``raised awareness of jihad'' within his circle, and ``indicated specifically since 2003 that he was preparing a violent act in Spain as an expression of the aforementioned jihad.''
Del Olmo issued five other European arrest warrants: Mohammed Oulad Akcha, Rachid Oulad Akcha, Jamal Ahmidam, Said Berraj and Abdennabi Kounjaa, all of whom are Moroccans.
They have been charged with hundreds of counts that include murder, attempted murder and membership in a terrorist organization.
On Tuesday, Angel Acebes, the outgoing interior minister, said the investigation is focusing on the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, which authorities have linked to bombings last year in Casablanca that killed more than 40 people, including 12 suicide bombers.
According to the court documents, Ahmidam rented a house outside Madrid where the authorities say fingerprints, traces of explosives and other evidence in the March 11 attacks was found.
The warrants identified the rundown house, in the town of Morata de Tajuna, as the site where bombs were made.
The court documents said Berraj is linked to Fakhet, the suspected Tunisian leader, and is also believed to have met in Istanbul in October with three members of al-Qaida.
The other three men are thought to have stayed at the house with Ahmidam and to have helped obtain the explosives used in the bombings.
The six men named in the warrants have been missing from their jobs and homes since the day after the bombings, Interior Ministry and court officials said.
They had b the officials said.
Until now, the Spanish news media had widely reported that Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan, was the prime suspect in the bombings.
According to the Spanish daily El Mundo, he was recognized by passengers on one of the trains.
His fingerprints also appeared in the home where the bombs were prepared, investigators were quoted in the newspaper as saying.
Since the attacks, 24 people have been arrested, most of them Moroccans.
Del Olmo, who is investigating the bombings, has sent 14 of them to prison.
All of the suspects in the investigation have denied direct participation in the attacks.
LETTER SAID TO BE FROM AL-QAIDA THREATENS SPAIN
Investigators on Monday studied a letter purportedly from al-Qaida promising ``an inferno'' unless Spain withdrew its troops from Iraq and Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the police reported the arrest of another suspect in the March 11 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,400.
In France on Monday, special forces rounded up 13 suspected members of a militant Islamic group thought to be behind bombings last year in Casablanca, Morocco.
After a tumultuous weekend, during which at least four suspects in the Madrid bombings blew themselves up, the newspaper ABC published in its Monday issue a Spanish translation of a letter written in Arabic that it had received by fax on Saturday.
It was signed Abu Dujana al-Afghani, who described himself as a member of ``al-Qaida of Europe.''
A videotape found two days after the train bombings had featured a man speaking in Arabic with a Moroccan accent who identified himself by that name and said he was the military spokesman of ql-Qaier said European Qaida operatives had demonstrated their strength on March 11 and with an unexploded bomb on rail tracks last Friday.
It said its truce with Spain was over, unless Spanish soldiers were withdrawn from Iraq and Afghanistan immediately.
If those demands are not met, the letter said, Spain will be converted into ``an inferno and your blood will flow like rivers.''
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who was elected new prime minister days after the train bombings, has pledged to pull troops from Iraq unless the United Nations takes over the occupation force.
But he has also said he$fqtors sending more troops to Afghanistan.
Security forces remained on high alert Monday.
Army and municipal police forces reinforced Spain's national police and home guard officers at subway stops, train stations and other heevyny
dpafficked public buildings, Ibanez said.
In France, counterterrorism police officers conducted a series of raids in multiethnic suburbs around Paris early Monday, detaining 13 people with suspected links to the militant Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group.
The group is believed to have orchestrated suicide bombings in Casablanca last May that killed 45 people.
It is believed to have ties to al-Qaida and has become a focus of the Spanish investigation into the March 11 attacks.
Six of those detained were members of an underground cell of theobeanization that had been under surveillance by the police for several months, investigators said.
Among those arrested was Mustapha Baouchi, a Moroccan citizen thought to be the leader of the terrorist cell, according to a senior official with the Directorate for Territorial Surveillance, France's counterintelligence service.
The official described him as an ``Afghan veteran'' who received military training in Afghanistan in 1998 and 2000.
The official added that of those six, four are French citizens of Moroccan descent and two are Moroccan citizens, all in their late 20s.
Three suspects are wanted under an international warrant issued by Morocco, and may face extradition, he said.
The special forces also seized documents, but no weapons or explosives.
SPAIN ARRESTS 3 MORE SUSPECTS IN TRAIN BOMBINGS
(Dale Fuchs contributed to this article)
By MARLISE SIMONS
c.2004 New York Times News Service
MADRID, Spain - On its last day before turning over power to the Socialists, Spain's conservative government announced it had made three more arrests of suspected Islamic militants.
Interior Minister Angel Acebes, just hours from stepping down, said that the three new suspects included a Moroccan, an Egyptian and a Saudi citizen, all of whom had contacts with a presumed leader of the bombing attack.
The news came shortly after the Socialist Party leader, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, was officially endorsed by Parliament as Spain's next prime minister in a vote that gave his government a comfortable major}: worn in by King Juan Carlos on Saturday, also told Parliament that he will make his first trip abroad - to Morocco - ``in the coming days'' to improve ties with the Moroccan government.
Spain's neighbor to the south is the source of most of its migrant labor, and also the home country of 15 of the 21 suspects now behind bars in connection with the March 11 train bombings.
The bombs that shook Spain and the rest of Europe, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,400, police said, are now largely thought to be the work of militants of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group.
This network, whose leaders trained in Afghanistan, has also been linked to suicide attacks in Casablanca in May 2003.
In the weeks following the attacks, cooperation between Spanish and Moroccan police has been close, according to Spanish investigators.
That, and the question of intelligence gaps and poor police coordination within Spain itself, has also occupied a prominent place in Zapatero's speeches and in debates in Parliament of the last two days.
The new prime minister vowed to make the fight against terrorism, whether domestic or foreign, a priority of his government.
As part of a new strategy, he said, he will place the anti-terrorism activities of the country's many security and intelligence services under a single, unified command.
``Our security forces will be better equipped, better coordinated and better informed,'' Zapatero said.
The reform, if carried out, will pool intelligence-gathering by Spain's civil guard, national police and armed forces, which all have their own intelligence services and often carry on parallel operations.
Zapatero has named Jose Antonio Alonso, a judge and close friend, as the head of a new ministry of security that will coordinate external as well as loMastic operations.
It will take over investigations into the train bombings from the Interior Ministry.
As part of the overhaul, Zapatero pledged he would add 36,000 more personnel to the security forces over the next few years.
He said he will create 1,000 new positions for judges and prosecutors and set aside funds to modernize the justice system.
In two final news conferences this week, Acebes recapitulated some of the current investigation into the train bombings.
He said police continued to use the same working premise of recent days, namely that the Madrid attacks were organized inside Spain, largely by Moroccans who built and planted the bombs.
He emphasized that these cells were now largely dismantled and their suspects either in jail or dead.
But he also said that a superior leader or several leaders with religious training and experience in Afghanistan may have been involved or orchestrated the operation from afar.
The arrests on Friday of a Saudi and Egyptian citizen, he said, were still too fresh to conclude that the Moroccan group in Spain was linked to a broader international network.
The minister said that the police were also following leads in Britain, France, Germany, Bulgaria, Belgium, Morocco and Tunisia.
Acebes also announced what he called ``a significant new blow'' against the Basque separatist group ETA following Friday's arrest in France of three suspects who had been wanted since 2001.
The French police had also discovered a workshop where electronic parts for bombs were assembled and tested by ETA.
Some bombs were also found.
WIRETAPS GIVE CLUES TO MASTERMIND OF MADRID BOMBING
Terrorists are not usually talkers.
But the man who calls himself the mastermind of the March 11 train bombings in Madrid is an exception.
For nearly three months, the Italian police have eavesdropped on Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, "Muhammad the Egyptian" as the 32-year-old Egyptian is known.
The contents of his conversations, both in custody in Milan, Italy, and before his arrest last month, have provided the police with a mother lode of information about the secret world of a man who claims to have recruited suicide bombers and organized terrorist operations in the name of Islam.
Dozens of pages of transcripts obtained by The New York Times and interviews with officials in Spain, Italy, Germany and France have shed light on Ahmed and his ability over the years to take on new identities, cross borders and avoid the police as he pressed his cause against the West.
They also offer a case study of the challenges and frustrations Europe faces in monitoring radicals, routing out sleeper cells and prosecuting and convicting those they arrest.
In Germany in 1999 and 2000, Ahmed served 16 months in a detention center, feigning different Arabic accents and pretending to be a "stateless Palestinian" seeking political asylum.
In Madrid in 2001 and 2002, he became friendly with a group of radical Muslims, some of whom were involved in the March 11 bombings and were killed in a suicide operation escaping the police.
In a Paris suburb in 2003, he eked out a living as an illegal construction worker and house painter.
In Milan, Italy, in 2004, he lived in an apartment in a tidy, upscale neighborhood, where he seemed to spend most of his day watching Arabic-language movies and news on satellite television.
"We looked for a job for him," said Ghazi Bidel, a 27-year-old Egyptian pizza maker who was his roommate in Milan.
"But he said he didn't want to work."
Last April, shortly after the Spanish police found Ahmed's Italian cell-phone number in the address book of one of two men suspected of involvement in the plot, the Italian police began tapping Ahmed's phone and bugging his apartment.
He shows off a computer program that activates numerous cell phones simultaneously -- similar to the technology used in the Madrid attacks -- and says he was in Madrid days before the bombings.
He declares that nationality does not matter in holy war, that he has converted drug dealers and criminals to the faith and that Muslims are allowed to marry Christians as a means of acquiring false documents.
He takes what he calls a "beautiful photo" of Yahia Ragheh, a 21-year-old Egyptian whom he is grooming to become a suicide bomber -- and who was arrested with him -- and tells him that it will be sent to his family and other militants after his death.
Even after his arrest on June 7, Ahmed was still talking.
In a conversation with Ragheh in a holding cell that night, Ahmed predicted that he faced a grim future behind bars.
"The minimum is 30 years," he said.
"I am too trapped."
Some of the conversations are included in a confidential Italian arrest warrant for the two men last month and were first reported by the Italian daily Corriere della Sera.
Last Tuesday, a Milan court ruled that the conversations were admissible in court and described Ahmed as a member of al-Qaida's terrorist network and a "promoter and organizer of a terrorist organization spreading Islamic terrorism" who had played "a high-level role" in the Madrid bombings.
But the case has also divided the police and intelligence and law enforcement officials in Spain's new Socialist government, exposing rivalries between agencies and a lack of trust between career officials and less experienced political appointees.
While some senior Spanish officials have expressed delight that Italy has Ahmed safely behind bars, others are upset that it has not yet granted Spain's request for extradition.
(STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
One example of the apparent lack of coordination in Spain is that key Spanish intelligence officials complain that they have not been given access to voice copies of Ahmed's conversations in Arabic, which they say are crucial for intelligence gathering.
But senior Spanish police officials acknowledge that the Italians began turning over the voice recordings to the Spanish magistrate in charge of the investigation even before Ahmed was arrested.
According to an internal Spanish Interior Ministry document, in Egypt Ahmed was a member of the terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, was attached to an explosives brigade during his military service and spent time in a maximum security prison for terrorist activities.
The request for information "was communicated to the Egyptian services," the report said.
"Unfortunately, these services have given us no data."
Meanwhile, Spanish investigators and intelligence officials are struggling to determine who exactly "Muhammad the Egyptian" is and how big a role he played in the bombings.
Spain's deputy prime minister, Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega, said at a news conference on June 11 that Spain had formally requested Ahmed's extradition because he had "very important responsibility" for the attacks.
The confidential extradition request of June 8 calls him "one of the people directly involved in the attack."
"We exaggerated to get the Italians to act," the official said.
The Italians have the right to bring Ahmed to trial for crimes committed on their soil before considering Spain's extradition request.
The only physical evidence found by the Spanish authorities against Ahmed is paper-thin: the presence of his cell-phone number in an address book believed to belong to either Fouad Morabit, a Moroccan, or Basel Ghalyoun, a Syrian.
Ahmed was identified by witnesses as having been in the apartment near Madrid where the train bombs were assembled.
And the Italian authorities have evidence that Ahmed called the cell phone of Morabit, who has been arrested in Spain, after the bombings.
Other potential evidence was found in Ahmed's computer, seized during the raid on his Milan apartment, including a downloaded program that allows the simultaneous setting of alarms on up to a dozen telephones, diagrams of explosive briefcases, vests modified for suicide attacks and a video showing the decapitation of Nicholas Berg, an American killed in Iraq in May.
Of the Madrid bombing, Ahmed said in an intercepted conversation on May 26, "The Madrid attack was my project, and those who died as martyrs were my dearest friends."
"I was ready to blow myself up, but they stopped me, and we obey God's will," he said.
"I had wanted a heavy burden, but I didn't find the means.
This plan cost me a lot of study and patience.
It took me two and a half years."
In a conversation on June 4 in which Ahmed was wooing Ragheh into becoming a suicide bomber, Ragheh posed for photograph that was to be distributed after his martyrdom.
"Come a little closer," Ahmed said.
"Stop, move just a little.
Like this it will be a marvelous day, with your face illuminated.
You have a light around your face.
It's not artificial.
It's a luminous light that will never leave your body."
Ahmed told his young charge that he listened to soothing cassette tapes of martyrdom continuously, and told him to do the same.
"They will make everything easier when you feel them enter your body," Ahmed said, explaining that a suicide mission "takes five minutes, and then everything blows up."
Ahmed talked and talked, despite expressing repeated concern that his phone was tapped, saying on April 12, "Listen to me, brother! Let's stop here.
I don't want us to be caught through the telephone!"
Despite all that talking, Ahmed has refused to cooperate with Italian investigators since his arrest and solitary confinement in a maximum security prison in Milan.
"He complains about not being able to talk to anyone except himself.
He is suffering."
SPAIN CONTINUES TO UNCOVER TERRORIST PLOTS, OFFICIALS SAY
One year after the worst terrorist attack in Spanish history, the Spanish police continue to uncover and thwart new plots involving Islamic militants, according to senior Spanish intelligence and law enforcement officials.
Despite sweeping measures to improve their ability to investigate potential terrorist threats since the March 11, 2004, bomb attacks that left 191 people dead, the officials estimate that there are hundreds of people scattered in cells around the country committed to attacking centers of power in Spain.
The police have found indications of a cell of Pakistanis that they suspect was planning an attack on a high-profile target in Barcelona.
They also found evidence of a cell of North Africans in Madrid that apparently wanted to attack Madrid's high court, the officials said.
"That means the threats have not disappeared."
As for the investigation into the Madrid bombing, it is far from over.
Spain is still hunting down at least half a dozen suspects, who are probably outside the country.
"The great majority of the perpetrators are identified, dead or in prison," said a senior intelligence official at the Guardia Civil, or Civil Guard, a police force with military and civilian functions.
"But we cannot say that we have all of them.
There are questions that remain unclear.
The most important is: Who masterminded March 11?"
Of 79 suspects believed to be involved in the Madrid bombings, 24 are in jail and awaiting trial.
Seven suspects blew themselves up in a Madrid apartment three weeks after the bombing to avoid capture.
13 ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH MADRID TRAIN BOMBINGS
The Spanish police took 13 people into custody on Friday in connection with the deadly train bombings here last year, including a man extradited from Belgium who is accused of being one of al-Qaida's top leaders in Europe, the Interior Ministry said.
" A senior police official, who requested anonymity because police rules prevent him from speaking about the investigation publicly, said Belhadj might have been the leader of al-Qaida's military wing in Europe during the time of the train bombings.
The 12 other men taken into custody on Friday in the bombings, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,000, were arrested in Madrid and charged with collaborating with terrorists.
They include six Moroccans, three Syrians, a Palestinian, an Egyptian and an Algerian.
Four of the men are close associates of Belhadj's, the Interior Ministry said.
Belhadj was arrested in Belgium on Feb. 1.
Investigators say he recruited Muslims in Europe and financed their trips to Afghanistan to train as terrorists.
Documents filed in court say that Belhadj was in Madrid a few days before the bombings.
The documents also say that he had contact with some of the men who carried out the attacks, including Sarhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet, a Tunisian who police officials say was the religious leader of the attackers.
Officials said it was not clear exactly what Belhadj's role was in the bombings.
But investigators are exploring the theory that he acted as a messenger who carried instructions from al-Qaida's most senior leaders -- Osama bin Laden and his closest lieutenants -- to the local cell in Madrid that carried out the attacks, according to the police official.
"We are working on the hypothesis that Belhadj could be such a messenger," the official said.
"But we do not have any objective evidence yet."
Investigators say that the decision to attack Spain may have been made during a February 2002 meeting of members of al-Qaida and their allies in Istanbul, Turkey.
Belhadj is thought to have been at the meeting, which, according to court documents, was coordinated by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian-born militant whose capture is a priority for American forces in Iraq.
Before Friday's detentions, the Spanish police had already arrested 81 people in connection with the attacks.
Twenty-five people have been jailed.
The trials are expected to begin in the summer.
BUSH CITES LEADERSHIP AND DOMESTIC INITIATIVES IN ASKING FOR SECOND TERM
( NEW YORK_Republican George W. Bush asked the American people Thursday night to give him a second term as president to build "a more hopeful" nation at home and pursue the "steady, consistent, principled leadership" required to win the world war on terrorism.
Bush, addressing the final night of the four-day Republican National Convention, told thousands of chanting, cheering delegates and guests at Madison Square Garden that he would devote a second term to changing the tax code, expanding health insurance coverage, protecting pension plans and improving worker re-training.
"And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me."
Bush came as close as he has ever come to acknowledging "shortcomings."
"You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too," Bush said, citing a tendency to mangle sentences, "a certain swagger"and coming across "a little too blunt."
"You and I have come to know each other,"Bush said.
"Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand."
The Nov. 2 election is the first presidential contest since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the first election since 1968 to take place with American GIs engaged in combat.
Bush, speaking three miles from the site of the destroyed World Trade Center, highlighted his campaign against the al-Qaida terrorist network that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks and defended his decision to wage war against Iraq based on what turned out to be faulty intelligence claiming stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.
The weapons Bush cited to justify the invasion of Iraq 17 months ago have not been found.
Bush said he would continue promoting democracy abroad to nations beyond Afghanistan and Iraq.
Bush took several road-tested swipes at Kerry by name,citing his opposition to his overhaul of Medicare, health-savings accounts, limits on legal and medical liability and his support for "more than $2 trillion in new federal spending so far."
Bush also threw red meat to the conservative right_a constituency he hopes to rally on election day.
He promised to "make a place for the unborn child," protect the definition of marriage between a man and woman from "activist judges," and promised to only choose federal judges who "know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law."
The war in Iraq and Bush's domestic policies sparked a variety of mostly peaceful protests on the streets of Manhattan during the course of the Republican convention, leading police to arrest more than 1,700 demonstrations since last weekend.
New York Gov.George Pataki introduced Bush with quips that ignited the hall.
Republicans were lucky heading into the final election push, Pataki said.
"This fall we're going to win one for the Gipper"_a reference to the late Ronald Reagan.
"But our opponents_they're going to lose one with the Flipper."
"They didn't bank on George W.Bush."
Retired Army Gen.Tommy Franks, who commanded the U.S. invasion of Iraq, took the podium to praise Bush in the face of Kerry's criticism that the White House had mishandled post-invasion planning for the U.S. occupation.
Bush addressed the convention as the White House braced for Friday's release of the latest unemployment and job creation statistics_a readily understood yardstick for economic recovery.
White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card, speaking shortly before Bush's speech, conceded that the new statistic would be politically sensitive.
Bush's second term agenda includes a $1 trillion, 10-year plan to revamp Social Security to permit younger workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes, private health savings accounts and permanent adoption of $1.7 trillion in tax cuts.
The Bush and Kerry campaigns jockeyed to be the first out of the starting gate for the 60-day sprint to the Nov. 2 Election in a race that has been a statistical dead heat for months.
The latest nationwide survey by American Research Group Inc., showed Bush and Kerry each having the support of 47 percent of likely voters in a survey conducted over the first three days of the four-day GOP convention.
Bush skipped a second overnight in Manhattan to rush to nearby Pennsylvania for the 34th visit of his presidency to get an early start in the first of four battleground states that he plans to visit Friday.
The Kerry campaign staged a midnight rally in Springfield, Ohio, minutes after the end of the Republican convention in New York City and planned separate weekend campaign trips by Kerry, vice presidential candidate John Edwards and the candidates wives.
to other battleground states
Kerry tours Ohio by bus; Edwards travels by bus through Wisconsin; Teresa Heinz Kerry hits Iowa and Elizabeth Edwards campaigns in Michigan.
At the Springfield rally, Kerry hit back hard at Republican attacks on his patriotism and fitness to serve as commander-in-chief.
"I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and by those who have misled the nation into Iraq."
Kerry served in combat in Vietnam, winning the Silver Star and the Bronze Star for valor and three Purple Hearts for wounds.

CONDITIONS IN OHIO POINT TO KERRY, BUT BUSH RUNS STRONG
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
Everything seemed to be in place for a powerful run by Sen.John Kerry in Ohio in the stretch drive after Labor Day.
Al Gore lost the state by 175,000 votes in 2000, despite having pulled all his advertising early in October.
Ohio has shed 250,000 jobs since George W. Bush became president.
Rocked by scandals and an unpopular tax increase, the statehouse Republicans, from Gov.Bob Taft down the line, have been in unaccustomed disarray for weeks.
At the end of last month, the Census Bureau reported that Cleveland, with a poverty rate of 31.3 percent, led the country in that most dubious category, and at the beginning of this month American deaths in Iraq topped 1,000.
Yet Kerry seems to be falling back.
Ahead by six percentage points in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in mid-July, Kerry trailed by nine points in a similar survey taken Sept. 3 through Sept. 7, immediately after the Republican convention.
Democratic professionals have begun to criticize Kerry's efforts -- privately and, in a few cases, publicly.
Snowboarding in Sun Valley, shooting skeet in the Ohio Valley and windsurfing off that great working-class vacation paradise, Nantucket.
Democrats -- at least Ohio Democrats -- play softball and touch football."
The campaign is far from over, of course.
"During summer a lot of Ohio people, like people many places, take a vacation not only from their jobs but also from politics, and many are just now refocusing on the contest," Rademacher said.
Robert T. Bennett, now in his fifth presidential race as the Ohio Republican chairman, predicted that "trench warfare, down at the grass-roots level" would continue right through Election Day, with a close finish the most likely outcome.
Frustrated in 2000 when Bush's lead shrank in the final 72 hours or so, the Republicans began preparations for 2004 more than a year ago, and 75 people from the state party are now in position around the state, along with 59,000 volunteers, and more than a million pro-Bush phone calls have been placed to voters.
Ohio is one of roughly a dozen battleground states, half of them in the Midwest, that appear likely to prove decisive in the presidential race.
With 20 electoral votes, it is a significant prize, but it has a certain iconic significance as well, because no Republican has ever been elected with out carrying it.
Both parties have mounted all-out efforts this time, with ample advertising and numerous appearances by their candidates -- no fewer than 66 visits this year by the presidential and vice presidential nominees.
On the very night that Bush accepted the Republican nomination at Madison Square Garden, Kerry made a midnight speech in Springfield, Ohio, between Columbus and Dayton.
Last week, his running mate, Sen.John Edwards, was in Chillicothe on Tuesday, Kerry himself spoke in Cincinnati on Wednesday, Vice President Dick Cheney was there on Thursday, and Bush campaigned in Portsmouth and Chillicothe on Friday, his fourth Ohio visit in just 16 days.
Chillicothe -- population a mere 21,796 but with access to several major media markets -- has a respectable claim, if only a fleeting one, to the title of crossroads of American politics.
More ranking politicians have come to town this year than it has seen in all the years since its heyday as Ohio's first capital two centuries ago.
Why this year?
Chillicothe is on the edge of -- and Portsmouth is in the heart of -- the state's hilly and chronically economically depressed Appalachian region.
Much of the region is represented in Congress by Ted Strickland, a Democrat.
Southern Democrats like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have fared well there, Bush barely won there four years ago, and it is widely seen as a pivotal area this year.
The president clearly hopes to do better this time, but the Kerry forces greeted him with a locally aired commercial focusing on the economy.
Its message: "In 2000, George Bush never bothered to come to Portsmouth.
Now, he's here promising to take 'the side of working families.
"Historically -- in Korea, in Vietnam -- as American deaths mount, public support gradually withers, more or less regardless of what politicians do," Mueller said.
"It's eroding now, but probably not fast enough to affect the outcome of this election, in this state or nationally.
Bush wants to make this year into 1944, and Kerry would like to make it more like 1968, I guess."
Another reason for Kerry's difficulties is demographic.
The state has been closely contested so far, but it is less representative of the nation as a whole than it once was.
As labor unions have waned and the suburbs and exurbs around cities like Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Toledo and Akron have flourished, the state has become more Republican.
The Republicans now have a 12-6 majority in the congressional delegation, and hold both Senate seats, the governorship, all the other statewide constitutional offices and both houses of the legislature.
"Since 1948, Ohio has slowly become less of a barometer," said Michael F. Curtin, president of The Columbus Dispatch, who has tracked Ohio politics for decades, "On average, it has voted 1.7 points more Republican than the country has.
The last Democrat to run stronger here than he did nationally was Lyndon Johnson in 1964."
DEBATE COULD SHOW THAT CLOTHES, IMAGE CAN COUNT MORE THAN MESSAGE
President George W. Bush and Sen.John Kerry tailor political messages not only with their words, but also their clothes.
When the presidential debates open Thursday in Miami, their sartorial selections won't be off-the-cuff statements.
Image will be among the elements scrutinized by pundits and voters.
Color.
Fit.
Cut.
Whether suits or khakis, every bit helps in an election as tight as spandex.
"It's a controlled image," said Anna Wildermuth, president of the Association of Image Consultants International.
Four years ago when Bush debated Vice President Al Gore for the first time, they dressed nearly identically in the unofficial uniform of a politician: dark suit, red tie.
The goal: Look presidential.
Think Hugo Boss, not Boss Hogg.
Expect the same Thursday night with minor, if any, adjustments, said veteran political consultant Bill Carrick, an adviser for Rep.Dick Gephardt's unsuccessful presidential campaign.
This election, Kerry -- along with a bipartisan roll call including New York Gov.George Pataki, Secretary of Commerce Donald Evans and Connecticut Sen.Joseph Lieberman -- has moved away from the traditional power tie to more whimsical neckwear.
He's wearing $65 Vineyard Vines ties (made in the USA) that weave in the trappings of the good life: lacrosse sticks, hot air balloons, parrots and palm trees.
He also has a custom-made campaign tie with JK04 and little American flags, which he wore on a Time magazine cover.
But Kerry's switch from swankier, European-made Hermes ties ($120-plus) represents a potentially knotty problem, especially for someone accused by his opponent of political weaving, Carrick said.
He should stay with it to be consistent," Carrick said.
"Bush is appealing to the very conservative, traditional man in his Oxxford suit," Wildermuth said.
"The biggest thing for Kerry is he has a very somber coloring.
He's trying really, really hard to choose colors that warm him up.
Now, he's gravitating toward powder blue.
While business garb should complement but not overshadow a candidate, it can become a political trademark.
Former Tennessee governor and past GOP presidential candidate Lamar Alexander turned a black-and-red plaid shirt into his personal billboard.
President Ronald Reagan wore a brown suit as his calling card.
Nixon wore no makeup and displayed a prominent 5 o'clock shadow during a TV debate.
Viewers and voters narrowly elected the more polished Kennedy.
"In a close election, knowing that 93 percent of a person's effectiveness as a communicator is judged on style, not content, we can expect appearance to play a large role," McClarie said.
Looking like a regular guy, though, has an appeal, especially in the small towns visited by both campaigns.
Bush has flashed boots and a big buckle: Gene Autry with launch codes.
When the president toured coastal parts of Alabama and Florida wrecked by Hurricane Ivan, he wore a light-colored windowpane shirt with gray slacks and casual brown shoes.
On Sunday, Kerry, dressed in a blue button-down shirt and casual pants, made an unannounced stop at the Main Street Pub and Grill in Mount Horeb, Wis., to drink a beer with Green Bay Packers fans.
Recently, after the presidential motorcade rolled impressively through a string of small Ohio towns, Bush put the pedal to the metal on folksiness.
He rolled up the sleeves of his blue dress shirt, worn with dark, pleated slacks.
"I like to get out with the people," Bush told the crowd in Ohio, one of the crucial battleground states that will help decide the November election.
"I like to tell people where I stand."
Roll up the sleeves and let's talk," Dave Gable, of Portsmouth, Ohio, said in a telephone interview.
The 57-year-old describes himself as an independent voter.
Kerry has displayed maximum comfort in his U.S. Senate garb -- dark suit, white shirt, dark tie.
Alice Carr, a Democratic voter in West Virginia, noticed Kerry's "aristocratic air."
But when the candidate appeared at the annual Labor Day picnic for the United Mine Workers of America in Racine, W.Va., Kerry struck a relaxed pose in a blue opened-collar shirt and khakis.
"I wouldn't have liked it," said Carr, a Kerry supporter.
"It was just a picnic.
You don't dress like that at a picnic."

BUSH, ON ROPES, JABS AT KERRY
President Bush is launching a multifront attack in an effort to regain momentum in the presidential campaign, assailing Senator John F. Kerry over taxes, health care, and national security as new poll numbers show the race narrowing to a statistical dead heat.
"My opponent believes that the federal government ought to be making your decisions," Bush said at a stop near Des Moines.
The message blitz, to be rounded out with what Bush advisers described as a major new address Wednesday, began four days after a disappointing debate performance sent Bush scrambling to regain the offensive.
Bush campaign advisers said their intent is to show the president acting strong and presidential - rather than appearing defensive, as he had during and after the debate - and to lay the groundwork for a debate in St. Louis on Friday that is expected to focus largely on domestic issues.
Bush began his new tact on the campaign trail Monday, hammering Kerry on domestic issues and national security.
"That means Saddam would not only have been in his palaces, that means he would have been in Kuwait as well," Bush said at a campaign event at a recreation center in Clive, Iowa.
If they were implemented, they would make this world not more peaceful, but more dangerous."
His campaign is underscoring that contention in the new ads released.
One claims that "John Kerry and the liberals in Congress" have voted for higher taxes 350 times - a figure that includes many instances where Kerry voted for a smaller tax increase instead of a larger one that was being offered, according to the Bush campaign.
At a campaign event in Hampton, N.H., Kerry fired back on the tax front by saying he backs further tax cuts for the middle class and only wants to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans to pay for new spending priorities.
...
Ninety-eight percent of America is going to get a tax cut under my plan."
His proposal relies on employer incentives and tax credits, not government mandates, and is not a universal-access plan along the lines of Hillary Clinton's.
The effort to put Kerry on the defensive in a variety of areas reflects Bush's attempt to refocus the race after several days of disconcerting poll news.
A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll released Monday showed Bush's pre-debate 8-point lead to have vanished, with the race knotted at 49 percent.
The Bush campaign is now honing its message to a few main themes where campaign aides believe Bush holds a distinct advantage over his Democratic opponent, with taxes and efforts to combat terrorism topping the list.
The campaign is shifting the focus of a campaign event Wednesday in Pennsylvania, to highlight contrasts between Bush and Kerry on the war on terror and the economy.

IN EXULTING BUSH THRONGS, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF ANXIETY
There is a good deal of nail-biting going on at the mostly picture-perfect campaign rallies held for President George W.Bush.
Terry Buck, a first-grade teacher from Cleveland, feels the nervousness.
So does Jim Nichols, a municipal purchasing officer from Saginaw, Mich.
Both turned up last week at big events for the president near their homes.
While they cheered endlessly, they also fretted some.
Bush should be trouncing Sen.John Kerry.
For unsettled Republican voters in battleground states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan and New Hampshire, the last leg of the presidential contest has at times been more of a group therapy session than a victory march.
In turning out by the thousands at airports, in stadiums, on farms and along roadsides -- some waiting four or five hours for a chance to spend 40 minutes listening to the president -- many Republican loyalists are seeking the strength and comfort that large numbers often bring.
There is certainly no panic, Nichols says.
Some of the loudest ovations come when the president predicts, as he almost always does in his speeches, "a great victory on Nov. 2."
But for every measure of hope there is some measure of anxiety gnawing at the adoring crowds that are shadowing the president the last days of his re-election campaign.
"I haven't talked to anybody who is not concerned," said Nichols, who took a day's vacation on Thursday to see the president at a hockey rink in Saginaw.
The videotaped message by Osama bin Laden televised Friday served to heighten the uneasiness.
"He is trying to make the president look incompetent," Bentley said.
"I just hope people will realize that he is trying to influence our democracy and our election."
"I tell my husband that I feel like I am pregnant and I just want to birth this baby so that I can know who it is," said Buck, who wore an oversize New York Fire Department shirt at a rally where Gen.Tommy Franks joined the president.
"My fear is that we will wake up Wednesday and we won't have a president."
There have been fireworks, confetti cannons and nonstop country music.
One venue had a jumping castle for the kids.
The president can barely complete a sentence without being interrupted on queue by chants of "Four more years!"
And while many walk away feeling better, they say their real hope is that Bush does the same.
"I already know I am voting for him.
At the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., Larry Trybulec, a manager at a wholesale flower company, and his wife, Judy Roland, a middle school art teacher, watched Bush address one of his biggest crowds of the week withbinoculars from faraway seats in section 122.
Trybulec said their attendance was a show of solidarity.
"I enjoyed telling people at work that I was coming," he said.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Of course, Bush has weathered a lot before this election.
A disputed vote in 2000.
Terror attacks.
Wars.
Even so, to many of his admirers in the Republican electorate, Bush could use the kind of boost that comes when friends show they care enough to give their time.
His chatty stump speeches encourage that belief.
"Thanks for being here," he often says at the beginning of his remarks, as if opening the door to his Texas ranch to a surprise visitor.
"You have lifted our spirits."
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Even in crowds of many thousands, people said they felt drawn closer to Bush by the interaction.
His wife, in a wheelchair because of a stroke, and two of his six children also looked on as the president spoke.
Another of his sons is a Marine in Iraq, he said.
"He is really connecting with people.
Karl Rove, the presidential adviser, surveyed the scene one night at a farm in Bucks County, where thousands of supporters stood shoulder to shoulder on a plowed cornfield.
A U.S. flag, basking in bright lights, hung from the side of a white barn.

Almost everywhere we go it is wild."

Whether it is all the calculated showmanship of a skilled politician, or the genuine George W. Bush refusing to be smothered by the political process, is not up for discussion at the rallies.
Ciccone said she refused to view the films or buy the compact discs of performers who campaigned for Kerry.
BUSH AND KERRY LOOK FOR CLEAR WINNER IN ELECTION OUTCOME
Exhausted and exhilarated, President Bush and Sen.John Kerry awaited the decision of voters in Tuesday's hard-fought presidential election following hurried Election Day campaign stops in Midwest battleground states that may decide the outcome of the most expensive election in American history.
Final pre-election nationwide polls showed the White House race remained a squeaker as tens of millions of voters cast ballots for president and Congress, state and local offices, in the first presidential election since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks three years ago.
Also at stake were 34 Senate seats, 435 House seats and 11 governorships.
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., appeared to be in the fight of his political life against his White House-backed Republican challenger, former Rep.John Thune.
Voting took place against the backdrop of ongoing U.S. military operations in Iraq and a code yellow security alert for "elevated risk" of terrorist attacks" that has been in effect since Jan. 10.
Bush voted with first lady Laura Bush and the couple's twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna, at a firehouse near their Crawford, Texas, ranch before a last-minute campaign stop in Ohio en route back to the White House to await the results.
Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts for 19 years, voted at his Boston polling site with his daughters Vanessa and Alexandra.
Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, cast her ballot earlier in Pennsylvania.
"I don't think anybody can anticipate what it's like to see your name on the ballot for president," said Kerry.
"It's very special.
It's exciting."
Legions of lawyers for both campaigns geared up for possible post-election court battles in a sequel to the razor-thin 2000 contest settled in Bush's favor when a U.S. Supreme Court ruling awarded Florida's electoral votes to the Republican.
Nearly one-third of the nation's projected 120 million voters were expected to cast ballots on ATM-style voting machines.
Early voting in 32 states added another wildcard to the race, with polls showing 17 percent -- or as many as 20 million voters -- already having voted by Election Day.
Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, predicted that voter turnout would range between 118 million and 121 million -- or as much as 60 percent of the nation's voting-age population.
That turnout would represent an increase of at least 13 million more voters than the 105 million who voted in 2000 and the largest share of voting-age population since the 1968 contest amid the Vietnam war.
"My hope, of course, is that this election ends tonight," Bush said in sentiments echoed by Democrats.
"There would be nothing better for our system than for the election to be conclusively over tonight."
Sen.John Edwards, D-N.C., the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, told CBS News' "Early Show" that "it just needs to be clear that somebody's gotten the electoral votes that are needed to be president."
Hours before polls opened in Ohio, Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens declined to have the high court review a federal appeals court ruling that upheld Republicans' decision to station GOP vote challengers inside polling places to double check voters' credentials, including many of the 800,000 new voters registered in the Buckeye State.
Six of nine incumbent presidents who have sought re-election since World War II have won.
Bush left nothing to chance, stopping in at an Election Day telephone bank in Columbus, Ohio, to surprise voter Julie Leahy with a personal call.
"Julie, this is President Bush calling.
How are you?
No, I promise you it's me," Bush told Leahy, before winning her support and hanging up, saying, "one to nothing."
Kerry urged supporters at a voter canvassing headquarters in La Crosse, Wis., before heading home to Boston to ignore the rain that swept parts of the Middle West.
"You know the job we have to get done in the next hours."
Democrats were looking for an unexpectedly large turnout by younger voters to bolster Kerry's chances for the White House just as a large turnout by 18-to-29 year old voters in 1992 helped elect Democrat Bill Clinton.
The last pre-election Gallup Poll showed the Kerry-Edwards ticket enjoying a 13-percentage point edge among that age group.
Young voters have "changed this country before and they could change this country again," Edwards said on CBS News' "Early Show.
" "If these folks participate and there's a big turnout, we feel very optimistic."

For Bush, 58, son of former President George Bush, the election would be the last of five elections in a fast-paced political career that saw him lose a 1978 race for Congress, win two elections for governor of Texas and run twice for the presidency.
For Kerry, 60, the election capped a political career in state and federal politics that began with a defeat for Congress as an anti-war candidate in 1972 and victory in five successive statewide elections in Massachusetts, once for lieutenant governor in 1982 and four times as a senator from Massachusetts.
Bush served during the Vietnam war as a stateside pilot for the Texas Air National Guard.
Kerry volunteered for Navy service and then volunteered to leave duty on an offshore destroyer to skipper a high-speed gunboat that was used on river patrols into hostile territory.
Kerry earned a Silver Star and Bronze Star for combat valor and three Purple Hearts for combat wounds before ending his Navy service as an admiral's aide.

FROM TEXAS TO WHITE HOUSE, BUSH EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE
For George W. Bush, as true a believer as has ever occupied the Oval Office, the day of judgment began on a dreary morning in a firehouse in the little town he made famous.
And he believed the election would turn -- in his favor -- on the signature issue that was forced on him early in his administration, the war on terror.
"And the people know that.
By mid-afternoon, Bush was back in the White House, surrounded by staff and family.
On hand to watch the election returns were his father, former President George H.W. Bush, his mother, Barbara, and two brothers, Marvin and Neal.
As he does on most days, the president found time for exercise, spending some time on an elliptical trainer in the White House.
After workout time, Bush hosted 25 to 30 family members and friends in the White House residence, where a buffet featuring seafood and Mexican dishes was set up.
The senior staff spent much of the evening in the White House Roosevelt Room, where a large screen TV and two smaller ones, as well as a screen linked to returns on the Internet, had been set up.
Throughout the White House, Bush aides carried Electoral College scorecards.
One side listed the "safe" Kerry states, carrying 191 electoral votes, and the "safe" Bush states, with 160.
The card listed the poll closing times in each state and left space for staffers to fill in the winners as the votes came in.
Earlier Tuesday, with final pre-election polls showing a close race, Bush made one more stop en route from Texas back to Washington.
Back in Ohio for the 33rd time in this campaign, Bush stopped in to talk to volunteers in a cobblestoned neighborhood of Columbus.
The two-room phone bank was typical of the operations the Bush campaign set up around the country in recent days to contact millions of voters right up until the polls closed Tuesday night.
"Leave No Phone Number Behind," read a banner, a take-off on Bush's "No Child Left Behind" education program.
"How's everyone?" a buoyant Bush said as he entered the room.
The president and Laura Bush mingled with the workers, thanking them.
Bush, making one last chance to reach out to a voter, picked up a phone and said, "Julie.
This is President Bush calling.
How are you?"
"No," Bush said, replying to something Julie said, "I promise you it's me."
I appreciate you taking my phone call.
Thank you very much," he said, confident of the woman's vote.
Outside the Columbus headquarters, Bush said his spirits remained high.
"I've had a couple of cups of coffee, I spent some quality time with my wife," he said.
"I am going to run this race out to its fullest.
I will be able to, we both will be able to, say that we campaigned as hard as we possibly could."
With that, the president who got the job four years ago in a contested race that left rifts that persisted through Election Day 2004 headed back to the White House to await the nation's decision.
On board Air Force One, the tension was broken as Bush and top staffers watched a slide show of campaign photos taken by Eric Draper, the photographer who covered the Bush campaign in 2000 for the Associated Press and then became the White House photographer.
Air Force One touched down on the tarmac at 1:45 p.m. on an unseasonably warm day in Washington.
Bush, his wife and daughters waved, left the plane and headed to Marine One for the brief helicopter ride that took them back to the Washington home the president hoped to occupy for four more years.

BUSH HAILS SWEEPING VICTORY FOR PARTY
George Walker Bush declared victory in the race for president on Wednesday driving a national election that bolstered Republican strength in Congress and led the White House to proclaim that Bush had captured a mandate for a second term.
Bush beamed as he stood with Vice President Dick Cheney at a rally in Washington, D.C., four hours after accepting a concession call at the White House from Sen.
John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who waged a fierce challenge to unseat him.
In calling the president, Kerry abandoned a threat to contest the election result in Ohio in deference to a decisive popular vote victory by a man who four years ago won the presidency with less than 50 percent of the popular vote.
The victory by Bush amounted to a stunning turn in fortunes for the nation's 43rd president, who had at times this year seemed destined to repeat his father's fate of losing a second term because of a weak economy.
Instead, Bush won more popular votes than any president in history -- 58.6 million, or 3.5 million more than Kerry, albeit in a nation with an expanding population of voters -- and positioned himself and his party to push through a conservative agenda in Washington over the next four years.
Bush became the first Republican president since Calvin Coolidge to win re-election while gaining seats in the House in the Senate; a gain of at least two in the House and four in the Senate.
While Republicans did not win enough seats to provide Bush a veto-proof Congress, the party's surge resulted in the defeat of Tom Daschle, the South Dakota senator who was the Senate minority leader and was one of the most familiar Democratic faces in Washington.
Republican leaders were promising to renew efforts to pass bills Democrats had blocked, such as one permitting drilling in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge and caps on lawsuit awards in liability cases.
Bush spoke only in the broad terms of what he might do in a second term.
But he strongly signaled that he was looking to stabilize the governments of Afghanistan and Iraq to allow the return of American soldiers.
Bush's easy victory appeared to clear the way for a reshuffling of his Cabinet, with John Ashcroft, the attorney general, and Tom Ridge, the Homeland Security secretary, leading a list of Cabinet members likely to leave, according to administration officials.
Cheney, in introducing the president at the rally at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center less than half mile from the White House, left little doubt about how this White House saw the election, and what it intended to do with it.
Bush's victory was powered in no small part by a huge turn-out among Evangelical Christians, who are now likely to seek a bigger voice in key White House decisions over the next four years -- in particular, nominations of Supreme Court justices that are certain to confront Bush in the months ahead.
"I want to speak to every person who voted for my opponent," he said.
"To make this nation stronger and better, I will need your support and I will work to earn it.
I will do all I can do to deserve your trust.
A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation.
We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us."
Kerry struck a similar tone in his concession speech in Boston -- which at 16 minutes, lasted six minutes longer than Bush's -- though it reprised, if indirectly, some of the criticisms he had made of Bush during the campaign.
" I hope President Bush will advance those values in the coming years.
I pledge to do my part to try to bridge the partisan divide."
"I know this is a difficult time for my supporters, but I ask you -- all of you -- to join me in doing this," said Kerry, whose voice cracked at times in an uncharacteristic display of public emotion
That said, by any measure, the Bush victory rocked the political landscape in Washington.
Aides to both parties said they were doubtful -- given the history of the past four years -- that the capital was headed for a period of political calm, no matter what the president and Kerry said in the aftermath of their bitter competition.
"George Bush won, and I congratulate him on that.
They need to be very careful that they now need to govern from the middle in a bipartisan way.
This country as we saw in the election is very evenly split."

For much of Tuesday and into Wednesday, it seemed as if the election of 2004 was turning into a reprise of the election of 2000, with a series of tight races and some confusion in counting combining to create a night of tumult and uncertainty.
At 2:30 Wednesday morning, Kerry's running-mate, Sen.John Edwards of North Carolina, went to the stage in Boston where Kerry had hoped to declare victory to say that the Kerry campaign was contesting the result in Ohio, and would not concede until all the outstanding votes there were counted.
Bush nearly appeared at 4 a.m. Wednesday to declare victory in the face of the Kerry campaign threat.
But the situation in Ohio was no where near as disputatious as it was in Ohio, and Bush's advisors decided to instead hold off in the hopes that Kerry would, upon awakening, decide the cause was hopeless and concede, which is what happened.
The 2004 election turned out to be different in another way as well: For all the fears of Democrats this year, Ralph Nader, the independent candidate, drew so few votes that he had no impact on the outcome of the contests in any of the states.
Edwards is likely to now seek his party's nomination that year, and thus is eager not to do anything in the final days of this campaign that could come back to haunt him in 2008.
U.S. RELIEF EFFORT IN ASIA OFFERS CHANCE TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
As Asia suffers through a 9/11 of its own -- a natural calamity instead of a man-made one, but at least 25 times more deadly -- President Bush's response in coming weeks may well determine his success in repairing relations strained by three years of relentless American focus on terrorism.
" His aides said it took that long to understand the magnitude of the tragedy and to plan a recovery effort that must stretch from remote villages of Indonesia to the eastern coast of Africa.
But the aid effort that has now begun presents Bush with an opportunity to battle, with action rather than just words, the perception that took root in his first four years in office that he is all about America first.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Andrew Natsios, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said on Wednesday that American funding for disaster relief alone was $2.4 billion last year, 40 percent of the worldwide contributions for this purpose.
"We are by far the largest donor," he said.
"No one even comes close to us."
But fair or not, perceptions set in a first term have a way of becoming the political canvas of the second.
Tracy Dahlby, a longtime Asia hand, notes in a new book about Indonesia, "Allah's Torch," that at least one poll shows that roughly 75 percent of Indonesians had good feelings about the United States in 2000 -- a period that followed the American intervention in the Asian financial crisis and the forced resignation of President Suharto.
That figure, he says, has fallen to about 15 percent.
" Another noted that such a reaction "is inevitable, even when good work is being done."
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Early reports indicate that even in a holiday week, the U.S. bureaucracy swung into gear fairly quickly.
But to some degree, the war of perceptions has to do with whether the Asian nations believe Bush focuses on the tsunami tragedy with the same kind of energy he put in to making sure that other nations signed on to his counterterrorism agenda after Sept. 11.
Just weeks after those attacks, Bush traveled to Shanghai for the annual summit meeting of Asian leaders and said that the world's foreign policy agenda must be redrawn, making it clear he would judge allies on the basis of how well they joined the fight.
Many responded.
Among the first visitors to the Oval Office after the attack was Megawati Sukarnoputri, then Indonesia's president.
She pledged to join the hunt for al-Qaida operatives on her territory, and largely made good on the promise.
The equivalent of that visit came Wednesday morning when Bush, operating from a trailer just across the road from his ranch that has been converted into a secure communications center, called the leaders of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia and India to pledge his support.
He acknowledged that it will take months to assess the damage and get help to the remote areas.
Yet as they measure the need, Bush's aides are aware that the depth of America's compassion will be compared with other yardsticks, specifically, what other nations are spending, what Washington spends on lesser disasters at home, and what is now being spent in Iraq.
Spain, with an economy a fraction of the size of the United States', has publicly committed about $68 million to the disaster.
Australia has pledged $27 million.
Then there are the domestic comparisons.
Congress has approved roughly $13 billion for aid related to the hurricanes that hit the country in the late summer and throughout the fall.
Most of that is going to Florida, where Bush personally loaded fresh water and dry goods into the trunks of cars.
Of course, that was home turf, and an election campaign was under way, and even Bush's critics do not expect spending on that scale for the far greater disaster in South Asia.
And there are already signs that Democrats want to link the response to this disaster to spending in Iraq.
"We spend $35 million before breakfast in Iraq."
BUSH ANNOUNCES FOUR-NATION DISASTER RELIEF EFFORT, MILITARY HELP IN WAKE OF TRAGIC QUAKE, TSUNAMI
President Bush announced Wednesday that the United States would head a group of nations coordinating relief to areas devastated by Sunday's earthquake and tsunami, while defending the speed and scope of the American response to the tragedy.
"We pledged an initial $35 million in relief assistance," Bush said in his first remarks since the disaster struck 12 nations in South Asia and Africa.
"We have deployed disaster experts to the region.
We're dispatching a Marine expeditionary unit, the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln and the Maritime pre-position squadron from Guam to the area to help with relief efforts."
The president indicated that the United States would continue to help over the long term.
"I spoke with the leaders of India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Indonesia, and expressed my condolences and our country's condolences," he said.
Secretary of State Colin Powell contacted leaders in Japan, Australia and India to set up a task force to administer world relief efforts, Bush said.
A State Department official had a teleconference Wednesday night with counterparts in those nations to lay out an initial plan.
Predictions regarding the eventual death toll soared.
"I think it's going to be well over 100,000," said Andrew Natsios, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.
As many as 3,000 Americans, mostly tourists in Thailand, had not been accounted for, the State Department said.
So far, 12 Americans were known to have died after the 9.0 earthquake off Indonesia created the tsunami that inundated areas in 12 nations.
"In the year 2004, our government provided $2.4 billion in food, in cash, in humanitarian relief to cover the disasters for last year," Bush said.
"That's 40 percent of all the relief aid given in the world last year, was provided by the United States government.
Natsios said that Sunday, within hours of the disaster, teams of American experts began assessing how much aid was needed and how it should flow into the ravaged countries.
The U.S. pledge of $35 million in initial relief tops the funds promised by individual countries so far, according to the Geneva-based U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
That money will end up being a small percentage of U.S. government and private assistance, including the costs of sending U.S. military ships and aircraft to the region, officials said.
The first U.S. military C-130s carrying supplies stockpiled in Dubai landed in Indonesia on Wednesday, said Lt.Gen.James Conway.
P-3 reconnaissance planes from a group of nine sent to the area made an aerial assessment of damage sites.
Two Navy task forces set sail for the region, Conway said.
One group of Navy ships and U.S. Marines, headed by the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, will operate out of a Thai base at Utapao.
The carrier, which has helicopters that can help evacuate the injured and deliver supplies, left Hong Kong and will arrive in the area in about seven days, Conway said.
The second task force, which includes the helicopter carrier USS Bonhomme Richard and a force of Marines, steamed from Guam for the Bay of Bengal to help with relief efforts in Sri Lanka and India.
It will arrive about Jan. 7.
Seven of the U.S. ships can each produce 90,000 gallons of fresh water daily to help alleviate fears of cholera from contaminated water.
The task forces will also have medical facilities.
Private aid organizations were receiving enormous pledges to help from U.S. citizens, officials said.
Bush and other officials urged people wanting to help to send money -- not food or clothing.
"If people give commodities, it'll take a month to get there, and the transportation costs are more than the value of the commodities," Natsios said.
SIGNIFICANT AID BEGINS ARRIVING IN TSUNAMI-STRICKEN REGIONS
Cargo-laden ships and planes converged Sunday on stricken coasts in Indonesia and other countries, and helicopters ferried food, water and medicines to desperate, isolated survivors.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and President Bush's brother and personal representative, Gov.Jeb Bush of Florida, left Sunday for Asia, and Secretary-General Kofi Annan of the United Nations will depart Monday to tour the hardest-hit regions and to join a conference of Southeast Asian nations in Jakarta, Indonesia, on Thursday to map a strategy for the relief effort.
Jan Egeland, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator, recounted progress in relief efforts in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and other nations.
It was only the beginning of a relief campaign that has drawn pledges of $2 billion from 40 countries.
But after a week of horrific reports -- with estimates of as many as 150,000 dead, 500,000 seriously injured, millions of homeless and hungry, and tens of thousands missing -- there was a sense of progress.
A fisherman, 24-year-old Tengku Sofyan, was found barely alive under his beached boat in Lampulo, in Aceh Province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
He had been trapped for a week without food and water, could barely speak and was badly dehydrated.
Lamsar Sipahutar, the director of search efforts in Indonesia, said that the government was ready to call off the search for missing people to concentrate on getting help to known survivors.
Indonesia, closest to the epicenter of the undersea earthquake, has said that 100,000 of its people were killed.
After days of red tape, washed out roads and bridges and other problems, substantial help was finally getting through, officials said.
A steady stream of cargo planes from many nations, and U.S. Black Hawk transport helicopters and C-130 cargo planes, continued to land supplies in Indonesia at the Banda Aceh and Medan airports.
Health officials in Sumatra said no major epidemics or medical crises had broken out, although the need for clean water and sanitation was urgent.
In Sri Lanka, government officials raised the death toll to 29,729, with 5,540 missing and more than 800,000 left homeless by the tsunami.
Aid officials said there was plenty of food and clothing, even a surplus.
But thousands of people were living in hundreds of small camps and other temporary shelters without adequate sanitation, and health officials in Colombo warned of the possibility of widespread disease.

IN RAVAGED INDONESIA, AID WORK IS AN ACT OF FAITH
Children ran after a truck as it made one of what have become daily deliveries of aid in the region.
MEDAN, Indonesia - The trail of aid from the Church of the Tabernacle of David begins at an unmarked storefront in an inconspicuous alley a few miles from the sanctuary.
Boxes from the Samaritan's Purse, the relief organization run by evangelist Franklin Graham, son of the Rev.Billy Graham, are stacked to the ceiling.
Pickup trucks laden with rice, biscuits, and mattresses arrive and are unloaded.
A church representative buys the goods from wholesale sellers with contributions from Indonesia and abroad.
Truckloads of the supplies leave the storefront in the evenings, arriving in the devastated city of Banda Aceh, 260 miles northwest, in time for the goods to be unloaded, then repackaged at a sprawling hotel serving as headquarters for church volunteers and countless others from Indonesia and abroad assisting them.
Members of a Bali surfers' group separate the goods into black plastic bags - one package of biscuits, one of dry noodles, one of milk.
The aid is then delivered to tsunami survivors in the ravaged northernmost tip of Sumatra island.
Volunteers from the Medan church, led by Pastor Sukendra Saragih, are among the thousands of humanitarian workers who have poured into Aceh Province, the epicenter of the disaster that struck two weeks ago, spurring one of the largest international aid efforts in history.
Saragih's outfit, although dwarfed by international aid groups, is the face of a new, grass-roots relief movement that is attracting unprecedented numbers to Aceh, a region that had been all but closed to outsiders, strangers because of Indonesia's 28-year conflict with separatists.
The church group's effort is not only challenging and grueling, it is also dangerous: Christians, a minority of about 8 percent in the world's most populous Muslim country, have often been targets of attack in Aceh, according to church leaders.
"I believe Aceh will change," he said.
Christian churches in Indonesia have launched what they call the largest Indonesian Christian response to a disaster.
A group that Saragih's church is assisting, Bless Indonesia Today, is spearheading a ministry appeal to raise $50,000 for administrative expenses alone, so that all other donations from the general appeal will go directly to assisting victims, according to IndonesiaWatch.org., a religious website.
In partnership with foreign missionaries, Indonesian churches are building on the work of Christians in the United States, where members of the National Council of Churches dispatched $1 million in immediate tsunami aid and set a goal of raising $5 million.
It's very sensitive," Dean L. Rompis, a 28-year-old member of a Church of the Tabernacle of David branch in Jakarta, said as he worked out logistics of aid convoys in flip-flops and a large blue sun hat at the Banda Aceh hotel.
"They might think we're here to preach gospel in a Muslim area."
Rompis asserted that pastors had been killed in Aceh in the past by the Free Aceh Movement, even as the Indonesian military is accused of killing thousands of civilians in Aceh.
"Right now, all the Christians are more concerned about humanity," he said.
"We are all the same nation.
We want to help them, not because of religion or tribe.
A call to duty
For some, a disaster as massive as this can shake their faith and cause onlookers to question why God would allow it.
But for Saragih, as for many of his Muslim counterparts, the suffering is simply a mandate to mobilize and assist.
When the earthquake and resulting tsunami hit Dec. 26, Saragih dropped all other plans and drove the next day with another pastor to Aceh, where he had spent nine years quietly working among a tiny community of Christians and building up contacts.
When he arrived, the city was unrecognizable, with hundreds of bodies scattered in a field across from the Kartika Hotel, which is run by a friend of Saragih.
He asked if the Kartika could be used for the humanitarian effort, and his friend, a civilian who has run the military-owned hotel for decades, agreed.
But as word spread of Saragih's work and of the scale of the disaster, the endeavor took on a life of its own.
Christian doctors from the Oregon-based Northwest Medical Team International came to stay a few nights in the front bedrooms.
Christian surfers known as "Conquerors of the Wave" arrived from Bali, sleeping five to a row on the floor in a back room.
A Christian political group arrived from Jakarta and camped out in a meeting room.
Korean Christians arrived, along with many others, crowding the hotel's corridors with their bedrolls and pitching tents on the front porch.
About nine days in, the operation became unwieldy.
The cooks wondered how many people to make food for every day and who all these new faces were.
Saragih said he wondered how he would pay the electric bill.
He grew exhausted, but could not take a rest.
To make matters worse, he received a phone call from the military asking whether it was true that he was charging people for staying there and taking advantage of this disaster?
No, he assured the caller; everyone stays for free, and eats for free, paying only a donation.
Still, the hotel has taken on the look of a refugee camp, with vats of rice cooked outside on smoky fires, unexpected guests begging for access to a bathroom from those lucky enough to have self-contained rooms, and the shelves behind the bar stacked high with clothes, shoes, and toiletries.
But even he has opened his little room to newcomers, laying four mattresses across the floor and housing at least five humanitarian squatters.
Just as the big-ticket aid agencies faced massive logistical difficulties until they agreed to meet regularly in Banda Aceh to coordinate their work, the groups at the Kartika finally held a meeting to decide how to divide up tasks and set rules.
With his blue hat shielding him from the sun, Rompis slowly began to organize the chaos.
"If I get a printer, I will ask everyone to fill out this form," he said as he canvassed groups about how long they intended to stay and what kind of goods they had brought to donate to the aid effort.
As evening fell, the weary Saragih propped himself up in the open doorway of the hotel lobby after a hectic day.
The delivery truck laden with rice and biscuits had made the 16-hour trek from Medan and deposited its daily load in the front yard.
Volunteers had sorted the goods into family-sized packages.
The drivers had loaded thousands of the packages into ragtag vehicles and left for coastal villages full of refugees.
That afternoon, he had watched volunteers load the packages onto a truck that finally pulled out of the Kartika parking lot and wound its way northeast down the coastal highway toward an area called Ladong, accompanied by a Globe reporter.
Alongside the road, children sat at tables lined with donation boxes.
Sometimes the truck stopped, and villagers ran after it, reaching for the packets handed out through the back door.
After about an hour's journey past ruined houses and flattened factories, the truck climbed a hill up to a refugee camp, where Idawati, a 25 year-old housewife, had taken refuge in a school with 90 other families.
Idawati, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, smiled shyly when the food and supplies were unloaded from the truck, one of about four aid deliveries that stop in Ladong every day.
She did not know whether Christians or Muslims donated the food - nor did she care.
"We just take everything.
We don't care where it is from," said Idawati, who fled with her young son up the nearest hill the moment she saw "the water stand up like a tree," ready to wash away her fishing village.
At another stop farther down the road, a wizened district officer named Yusman Ahmad smoked and fiddled with his false teeth under a tarp as he presided over mountains of rice, used clothes, and medical supplies.
Ahmad estimated the huge bags of rice would only last two days, as they had to feed 2,800 people.
When asked whether every religion was free to donate to the camp, Ahmad nodded his head.
Relieved of its load, the truck headed back to the Kartika Hotel.
Back at the headquarters, the delivery was reported as a success.
But the volunteers returned to discover the stunning news that about 50 bodies had been found outside a church, struck down by nature on the day after Christmas with a force that has been described as biblical.
First, the earthquake struck, prompting parishioners to run outside as their church crumbled.
Then, the giant wave came, killing what appeared to be the entire Sunday school.
"I think he did this to show us that he is still almighty, that there is something bigger than the power of man."
A short distance away, in the lobby, Saragih looked a shade more ashen.
As he talked about plans to be in Aceh, on and off, for the next two years, he acknowledged: "Physically, I am very tired.
And that's why I have persevered."
BUSH NEARLY TRIPLES TSUNAMI AID REQUEST TO CONGRESS
President Bush said Wednesday he would ask Congress for $950 million for tsunami relief, nearly tripling U.S. aid pledged for victims of the monstrous seismic wave that swept the Indian Ocean in December.
The beefed-up aid proposal, to be part of a supplemental budget request to go to Congress later this week, includes money to cover emergency relief efforts as well as new funding to help rebuild bridges, roads, schools and housing destroyed in a natural disaster that took some 150,000 lives.
In a statement, Bush said the money would help restore communities and rebuild "vital infrastructure that re-energizes economies and strengthens societies" in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and other countries that bore the brunt of the tsunami's wrath.
Days after the Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami rocked the Indian Ocean region from Indonesia to the horn of Africa, Bush pledged immediate aid of $35 million.
He quickly raised that pledge to $350 million.
On Wednesday, he increased that pledge by another $600 million.
Some $236 million has already been spent in emergency aid and military rescue efforts.
The $950 million Bush is requesting includes money to cover those efforts as well as longer-term reconstruction aid needed to continue addressing victims' needs, said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz.
(Optional add begins here)
The new aid request will be part of an $81 billion supplemental budget request the White House is expected to send up to Capitol Hill later this week.
Most of that money will go to fund continuing military operations in Iraq - now costing an estimated $5 billion a month - and Afghanistan.
The tsunami relief request includes:
- $346 million to replenish costs incurred by the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Pentagon for emergency relief and humanitarian aid.
- $339 million for rebuilding roads, bridges, schools and other critical facilities.
- $168 million to provide food, shelter, grants and loans aimed at helping victims to get back on their feet and restoring their communities and local economies.
- $62 million to help governments in affected countries plan long-term rehabilitation efforts.
- $35 million for ocean-borne sensors and transmitters to make up an early warning system to signal oncoming tsunamis and typhoons.
(Optional add ends here)
In addition to the official U.S. assistance, private American donors have provided more than $800 million in corporate and individual donations toward various tsunami relief efforts, said Alan Larson, undersecretary of state for economic, business and agricultural affairs.
At the height of the U.S. emergency response, there were some 16,000 U.S. military personnel in the Indian Ocean region, Wolfowitz said, aboard 26 U.S. warships.
Those concerns have abated, said Wolfowitz, a former U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, as the U.S. military presence in the region has been reduced to some 3,600, many of whom are aboard the Mercy, a naval hospital ship that has treated more than 2,500 Indonesians seriously injured by the tsunami.
"We came, we gave help and we left," he said.

DOCTOR'S AID TO TSUNAMI VICTIMS CHANGES PERSPECTIVE
The woman stumbled into the makeshift health clinic in Banda Aceh, Indonesia.
Five weeks after being knocked unconscious in the Dec. 26 tsunami, she complained of headaches and disorientation.
Dr. Michael Geci Black, who took time off from his job as an emergency room physician at St.Peter's Hospital in Albany, examined the woman.
He decided she needed a CAT scan for head trauma.
He walked with the patient to a nearby Indonesian Army Hospital, passing hundreds of armed soldiers along the way.
Through an interpreter, Black asked them to airlift the woman to the nearest medical facility with a CAT scanner, a one-hour flight.
"They held their rifles, smoked their cigarettes, drank their soda and stared at me.
They wouldn't lift a finger," Black said.
Eventually, Black arranged for her to to go to a nearby hospital.
He never found out if the woman received a CAT scan because the Banda Aceh clinic was swamped with more than 500 patients daily.
The only American physician on site, he worked 12-hour shifts alongside doctors from Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
He treated patients with malaria and typhoid, and with respiratory problems from the burning of debris.
Black's plan to treat survivors of the tsunami that killed more than 170,000 people in 11 nations, including more than 125,000 in Indonesia, collided with geopolitics.
Banda Aceh is the northernmost province on the island of Sumatra.
It has a history of resistance and distrust of outsiders.
The Acehnese, who are Muslim, fought against Dutch colonial occupation in the 19th century and control by the Indonesian military in recent decades.
Since the late 1970s, rebels with the Free Aceh Movement-GAM have waged guerrilla warfare against the government.
The province has been shut off to visitors and ruled by martial law.
He returned recently after a few weeks in Banda Aceh.
He paid his own way and took time off.
He volunteered under the auspices of United Planet, a Boston-based humanitarian agency that works in developing countries.
The experience put the American doctor's workaday world in perspective.
Where do you begin to rebuild?"
Now, slightly more than two months after the tsunami struck, relief efforts are shifting from emergency needs of medical care, shelter and food to long-term treatment, such as mental health counseling.
Black said he saw no mental health professionals while he was there.
Physicians prescribed Valium to the distraught.
"A lot of people came with psychological problems, but there wasn't a lot we could do for them," Black said.
Eric Hardiman, a State University of New York at Albany associate professor of social welfare, hopes the four-day training he helped lead last month for 50 Indonesian educators, psychologists and doctors will begin to fill gaps in mental health services.
"It was a partnership that hopefully will begin to snowball and produce a contagion effect that spreads across Indonesia," Hardiman said.
The plan in this "training the trainers" approach is that the 50 Indonesians will pass along the strategies to 50 more and the sphere of influence will grow exponentially.
The Red Cross estimates 35,000 children in Indonesia lost a parent or close family member in the tsunami and about one-third of them are still seeking an identity match or closure on their missing parents.
Hardiman has immersed himself in Indonesian culture since he was a student at the University of California at Berkeley, where he began playing gamelan, traditional Indonesian music.
He currently plays with a group called Gamelan Giri Mekar at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.
"I hope to be able to go back and follow up."
Hardiman's training in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital city, late last month was a collaboration with professors from Ohio State University and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
Hardiman's travel costs and lodging were paid for by SUNY Albany and the Indonesian Ministry of Sport.
It was titled "The International Workshop of Addressing Trauma and Depression of the Post-Earthquake and Tsunami Through Sport."
Hardiman based his training on U.S. studies that show physical activity and team sports can help alleviate depression in children.
Black and Hardiman agree the cultural divide may be the biggest challenge ahead.
Indonesia has 350 ethnic groups, each with unique cultural nuances.
If this is going to work, it's going to have to be done from within," Hardiman said.
"They experienced a staggering, mind-blowing loss," said Hardiman.
"Depression, withdrawal, lack of enthusiasm and other symptoms the children are experiencing are very normal."
"Just a few weeks after the tsunami, they managed to smile and laugh.
They were hard at work rebuilding.
BC-MERCY-MAPPING-SPI USING HIGH-TECH MAPPING TO AID TSUNAMI VICTIMS
Glenn Brooks once used remote sensing and computerized mapping technology to track down and nab crooks in Alaska.
Now, Brooks and a gang of volunteer data crunchers plan to use GIS -- geographic information systems -- and other high-tech mapping technologies to assist with the rebuilding efforts in Indian Ocean communities devastated by the tsunami.
He leaves for Sri Lanka Friday.
"It's an experiment," the former Anchorage police officer said.
"I think it will make a big difference, but we need to demonstrate that it can work."
Brooks left police work years ago to pursue a career in GIS technologies and now works for Mercy Corps out of donated space on the University of Washington campus.
The Portland-based relief organization is sponsoring the project to see if Brooks and his team can use their talents at processing satellite imagery, GPS measurements and sophisticated computer mapping techniques to help Indonesian and Sri Lankan villagers find the best sites for building homes, digging wells or catching fish.
About 75 people have volunteered, many of them experts with the Central Puget Sound GIS Users Group.
UW students, through the Marc Lindenberg Center at the Evans School, are pitching in as well.
"The question now for these communities is what to do about reconstruction," said Steve Claiborne, Mercy Corps' director of operations.
"We want to provide people with the information they need to rebuild their lives."
The Dec. 26 earthquake and tsunami did much more than kill people and destroy homes.
The massive wall of water literally wiped communities off the map and redrew the coastline in some areas.
Sources of fresh water are contaminated by seawater.
Once fertile fishing grounds are now barren.
Property disputes have arisen over who owns what, and between locals who wish to rebuild and officials who want them to relocate.
In some areas of northern Indonesia, where the government continues to battle with separatist rebels, some aid groups say there still may be remote communities that have yet to receive adequate food and basic relief supplies.
How can a map, even a computerized map, help solve such complex problems?
"It's better to think of this technology more as a collection of a lot of different kinds of spatially related information," said Dave Brown, a GIS expert and member of Brooks' team.
"Our job is to take all those layers of information and make maps out of it."
Unlike a printed map, Brown noted, GIS produces an interactive computerized map that allows the user to zoom in and out, focus on specific questions or tasks and continually update with new information (like a satellite image of a newly built road or evidence of people migrating into or out of a region).
Disaster relief initiatives often tend to get launched with plenty of good intentions and not much reliable information, Claiborne said, which makes for some disorganized and even futile efforts.
But information is power.
Brooks had first intended to go to northern Indonesia because the need is greatest there.
But Indonesia has been unpredictable lately in its policy toward relief organizations, so he instead decided to take the pilot project to Sri Lanka, where the government has been less skeptical of relief organizations.
Also, the Sri Lankan government and the Tamil rebels have established a steady, if at times uneasy, peace.
Claiborne said Mercy Corps recognizes that GIS mapping is "pretty high-powered stuff," so the organization will work closely with government officials.
They plan to use the mapping technology to help communities make decisions, he said, but likely won't be distributing the maps to locals if there's any government concerns about doing so.
In Sri Lanka, a British group of GIS experts called MapAction has already familiarized officials with the technique.
MapAction arrived in Sri Lanka just three days after the tsunami and used GIS to help coordinate emergency relief for three weeks.
Now, Mercy Corps wants to see if the technology also can be used for the longer-term reconstruction and development efforts by focusing the power of this information on specific communities' needs and rebuilding projects.
Before the tsunami, Brooks was using GIS technology to try to help Mercy Corps locate people who had fled their villages due to violence in Sudan's Darfur region.
He used GIS to identify watersheds and grasslands suitable for refugees.
Now, he will head to Sri Lanka to see if his team can make an impact on the tsunami reconstruction front.
Brooks will be followed by Daphne Karypis, a GIS expert with experience using the mapping technology for landmine-removal efforts.
Academic experts and students with the UW's Mark Lindenberg Center for Humanitarian Action, International Development and Global Citizenship have offered to assist with -- as well as learn from -- the Mercy Corps project.
Working in donated UW space on donated Intel computers, using GIS and image processing software donated by Leica, ESRI (a leading GIS company) and others, Brooks' colleagues in Seattle have spent the past few months collecting images and data to help them assist those working in the tsunami disaster areas.
Mercy Corps has agreed to cover the other costs of this pilot project for six months.
The organization's GIS Seattle Data Center will stay in constant communication with Brooks, Karypis and others, who will begin operations in the Sri Lankan community of Arugam Bay on the southeast coast.
The idea will be to use satellite images, GPS readings and interactive maps to respond to the specific needs of these hard-hit communities: Where should we rebuild? Where is the most likely place to dig a well for fresh water? Where are the best fishing grounds now? The answers will be different in every community.
"This technology has been in use a long time, but not much in the humanitarian community," Brooks said.
BUSH ADMINISTRATION MOVES CAUTIOUSLY ON CLIMATE CHANGE
The U.S. Climate Change Science Program, a consortium of 13 federal agencies, opened a three-day conference on such issues as the way climate events are monitored and recorded, the models scientists use to study the phenomenon, natural variability in the climate and human contributions to change.
Citing uncertainties about these and other issues, President Bush in March 2001 rejected the Kyoto Protocol, a climate change treaty that former President Clinton signed but never submitted to the Senate for ratification.
In its place, Bush called for an essentially voluntary program of greenhouse gas reduction and energy efficiency for the next 10 years _ and further study.
The three-day conference appears to be dominated by the departments of Commerce and Energy, but also includes environmentalists and other outsiders.
Delegates were presented a 177-page draft statement to be reviewed during the week and finalized Thursday.
``What we are arguing is that we need more information to have a clearly articulated policy that is practical,'' said Marburger, former president of the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
He noted that scientific findings reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations initiative that led to the Kyoto Protocol, was omitted from the draft scientific statement.

One agency that seemed under-represented at the conference was the Environmental Protection Agency.
Organizers said more than 1,500 persons had signed up to attend at least some sessions.
A list of 1,000 officials attending the meeting, most of them from the federal government, included names of only 15 EPA employees.
Among persons not on the list was Robert Watson, the former NASA scientist who headed the United Nations panel on the Kyoto agreement until he was sacked earlier this year in a parliamentary maneuver supported by the Bush administration.
Among those whose names did appear were industry lobbyist Donald Pearlman and Southern Co.official Robert P. Gehri, who were reportedly involved in the maneuvering to have Watson replaced, and Randy Randol, an Exxon Mobil lobbyist to whose fax machine memoranda recommending the action were traced.

BIPARTISAN ON WARMING
On Thursday the Senate has a chance to take the lead on this issue when it votes on a bill sponsored by John McCain and Joseph Lieberman.
This bipartisan measure asks much less from US industry than the Kyoto Protocol does.
But at least it begins the process of treating the chief greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, as an emission that has to be reduced if the planet is to avoid severe and unpredictable changes in weather, wildlife, and agriculture because of the warming that occurs when man-made gases function as a greenhouse layer above the earth's surface.
Under the McCain-Lieberman bill, major energy, transportation, and manufacturing companies would have to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to year 2000 levels by 2010.
To keep costs manageable and give firms maximum flexibility in achieving this goal, the bill calls for establishment of a market-based emissions trading program similar to the one that has worked well for reductions of acid-rain-causing emissions.
Rwt a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study published in June found that the cost of the bill would be minimal _ about one-10th of 1 percent, or $20 per household for the years it takes for industry to come into compliance.
In July, leaked documents showed that Bush's own Env5977ere suppressed.
F%w Rupporters of the bill expect it to pass in its first Senate test.
But a substantial vote in favor would indicate that the Senate has come a long way from its 95-0 vote in 1997 for a nonbinding resolution expressing concerns as the Kyoto Protocol was being finalized.
Since then, research has only strengthened the conclusion of most scientists that global warming is occurring and that the emissions of cars, factories, and power plants add to it.
Kyoto's critics fault it for not demanding equal reductions from India, China, and other developing countries.
But it is unrealistic to expect efforts from those countries as long as the world's largest producer of carbon dioxide sits on the sideline.
With 4 percent of the world's population, the United States emits 25 percent of all greenhouse gases.
Passage of McCain-Lieberman _ preferably this year _ would demonstrate to the world that not all Americans are locked in a state of denial about this threat to the planet.
EFFECT OF KYOTO PROTOCOL DEBATED AGAIN
Russian ratification of the Kyoto Protocol would leave U.S. companies cut off from new markets worth billions of dollars, according to supporters of the treaty aimed at limiting "greenhouse gases."
Although the United States signed the treaty in 1997, it has withdrawn from it.
Members of Russian President Vladimir Putin's cabinet were signing on this week to his request that the Duma, the lower house of the country's parliament, ratify the treaty.
If that happens, it will satisfy a provision that says the agreement goes into force 90 days after it is ratified by industrialized countries responsible for 55 percent of the 1990 global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
The treaty has been ratified by more than 100 countries, including Japan and all countries of the European Union.
But the refusal of the United States and Australia to sign up means that only Russia had sufficient 1990 emissions to push the total up to the 55 percent figure and bring the agreement into force.
The accord sets 1990 as a baseline year against which developed countries must cut emissions, and provides a trading mechanism whereby countries that produce less greenhouse gas than their 1990 baseline can sell "allowances" to those that fail to do so.
"Russia will benefit from a great wealth transfer as EU funds flow into the country in exchange for rights to Russian carbon dioxide allowances," Institute President William O'Keefe said.
"The tangible effect on carbon dioxide emissions will be nonexistent."
By some estimates, because of Russia's economic decline following the 1991 breakup of the former Soviet Union, its industrial activity -- and therefore its production of greenhouse gases -- has declined.
Illarionov argued that Russia is growing fast enough that it soon will produce more than enough greenhouse gases to exceed its 1990 baseline.
Caps placed on further emissions will inhibit the country's economic growth, he said.
"They can't both be right," Petsonk said of the opposition from O'Keefe and Illarionov.
Russia will sell greenhouse gas allowances and use the income to help finance modernization of its economy, thereby reducing its emissions, she predicted.
Benedikt(cq) von Butler, a greenhouse gas broker with the London-based energy broker Evolution Markets LLC, said the Kyoto treaty was drafted with the assumption that U.S. participation would offset the large volume of Russian allowances.
"It was assumed that America would suck up all the Russian hot air," he said in a telephone interview.
"Now the European Green parties are insisting that the Russians do more than merely sell allowances, insisting that they want to see some economic benefit."
The protocol was signed by the United States and other countries in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan.
Shortly after taking office in 2001, President Bush withdrew the United States as a signer.

U.S. TURNS ITS BACK ON GLOBAL WARMING
There's one in every neighborhood: the petulant, uncooperative homeowner who refuses to cut the grass in his front yard, drives faster than the speed limit and is content letting others pick up trash he thoughtlessly dumped at the curb.
You know the type.
After almost eight years of negotiation and delay, the Kyoto Protocol officially goes into effect Wednesday.
The international treaty binds 131 industrialized nations to gradually lower their output of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse gases" produced by human activities such as burning coal to produce electricity.
A lengthening list of scientific studies conducted by our own government as well as independent researchers has confirmed that the proliferation of these gases is melting ancient glaciers, raising sea levels, endangering low-lying areas and threatening the survival of plant and animal species around the world.
All of the European Union countries have ratified the treaty, as has Russia, a reluctant latecomer hoping to join the organization for economic, if not environmental, reasons.
Besides America, the only other Kyoto holdouts with mature economies are Australia and Monaco.
There's a great irony here: One of the reasons negotiations dragged on so long was the initial insistence of U.S. officials that the final Kyoto document contain a "cap-and-trade" system.
As envisioned, participants that reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions more than required by the treaty would be allowed to sell their excess pollution "credits" to companies that exceed their mandated limits.
The problem isn't only that many of our elected officials have spurned the Kyoto Protocol, it's that they've refused even to admit that global warming is occurring.
Since the United States, with 4 percent of the world's population, is responsible for 25 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, it's incumbent that we show leadership befitting world's last remaining superpower.
That isn't happening.
Bush and the nation's lawmakers have refused to increase fuel efficiency for American-made cars and trucks, an overdue move that would lower carbon emissions while reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy.
They've also been lukewarm to forward-looking legislation such as the McCain-Lieberman Climate Stewardship Act that would mandate limits on greenhouse gases for polluting industries.
Given the projected rate of global warming, some fear Kyoto may be too little, too late.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair recently pointed out why it's critical for the United States to remember the good-neighbor policy when it comes to global warming.
This editorial appeared in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
It sets the world on a course to economic disaster while doing nothing to alleviate global warming.
Kyoto attempts to alleviate what may be a major cause of warming -- the emission of greenhouse gases -- by suppressing energy use in the developed world.
Yet energy use is vital to modern health and wealth.
The Kyoto treaty itself recognizes this fact by exempting developing countries, eager to achieve prosperity, from greenhouse gas reductions.
As a result, China and India are likely to become the major emitters of greenhouse gases on the planet within a few decades.
This means that, even with Kyoto, global emissions of greenhouse gases will continue to increase.
So the Kyoto Protocol will do virtually nothing to halt any possible global temperature increase -- the temperature that would have been reached in 2100 will be reached in 2106.
Yet independent analyses of the annual cost to the world of complying with Kyoto put it at between $150 billion and $350 billion a year (the global development aid budget is $50 billion annually).
For a fraction of the annual cost of Kyoto, we could do much to alleviate these problems -- and thereby render any possible effects of global warming much more manageable.
We do not know what the extent of future warming will be.
One such key strategy is to allow and encourage the creation of wealth around the world.
For example, when several hurricanes hit Florida last year, the death toll was low.
But when those same hurricanes hit Haiti, thousands died.
The hurricanes were not appreciably stronger over Haiti, but Florida, being richer, proved more resilient.
By eliminating barriers to wealth such as trade restrictions and building up incentives to wealth such as property rights, we can put the world on the path to prosperity.
Then if the world does turn out to be appreciably warmer, the effects will be less in a more resilient world.
Kyoto supporters argue that this treaty is just a first step, and they're right -- it is a step in the wrong direction.

REBUFFING BUSH, 132 MAYORS EMBRACE KYOTO RULES
Unsettled by a series of dry winters in this normally wet city, Mayor Greg Nickels has begun a nationwide effort to do something the Bush administration will not: carry out the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.
The mayors, from cities as liberal as Los Angeles and as conservative as Hurst, Texas, represent nearly 29 million citizens in 35 states, according to Nickels' office.
They are pledging to have their cities meet what would have been a binding requirement for the nation had the Bush administration not rejected the Kyoto Protocol: a reduction in heat-trapping gas emissions to levels 7 percent below those of 1990, by 2012.
On Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg brought New York City into the coalition, the latest Republican mayor to join.
Nickels said that to achieve the 7 percent reduction, Seattle was requiring cruise ships that dock in its bustling port to turn off their diesel engines while resupplying and to rely only on electric power provided by the city, a requirement that has forced some ships to retrofit.
And by the end of this year the city's power utility, Seattle City Light, will be the only utility in the country with no net emissions of greenhouse gases, the mayor's office said.
Salt Lake City has become Utah's largest buyer of wind power in order to meet its reduction target.
In New York, the Bloomberg administration is trying to reduce emissions from the municipal fleet by buying hybrid electric-gasoline powered vehicles.
" Nickels said he decided to act when the Kyoto Protocol took effect in February without the support of the United States, the world's largest producer of heat-trapping gases.
On that day, Nickels announced he would attempt to implement the agreement himself, at least as far as Seattle was concerned, and called on other mayors to join him.
The coalition is not the first effort by local leaders to take up the initiative on climate change.
California, under Gov.Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, is moving to limit carbon dioxide emissions, and Gov.George A. Pataki of New York, also a Republican, has led efforts to reduce power plant emissions in the Northeast.
Michele St. Martin, communications director for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the Kyoto Protocol would have resulted in a loss of 5 million jobs in the United States and could raise energy prices.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
But many of the mayors said they were acting precisely out of concern for the economic vitality of their cities.
Nickels, for example, pointed out that the dry winters and the steep decline projected in the glaciers of the Cascade range could affect Seattle's supply of drinking water and hydroelectric power.
The mayor of low-lying New Orleans, C.Ray Nagin, a Democrat, said he joined the coalition because a projected rise in sea levels "threatens the very existence of New Orleans."
"I'm hoping it sends a message they really need to start looking at what's really happening in the real world," Arakawa said.
Nickels said it was no accident that most cities that have joined are in coastal states.
The mayor of Alexandria, Va., is worried about increased flooding; mayors in Florida are worried about hurricanes.
But Nickels has also found supporters in the heartland.
Jerry Ryan, the Republican mayor of Bellevue, Neb., said he had signed on because of concerns about the effects of droughts on his farming community.
Ryan described himself as a strong Bush supporter, but said he felt that the president's approach to global warming should be more like his approach to terrorism.
"You've got to ask, Is it remotely possible that there is a threat?"' he said.
"If the answer is yes, you've got to act now."
U.S. TO JOIN CHINA AND INDIA IN CLIMATE PACT
The United States plans to join China and India in an Asian-Pacific climate agreement intended to replace the Kyoto pact as a method to control greenhouse emissions, an official attending the annual conference of Asian nations in Vientiane, Laos, said Wednesday.
The new five-member pact, described as an initiative of the Bush administration, would group the United States and Australia, developed countries that have not signed the Kyoto accord, with China and India, major producers of greenhouse emissions.
Even though they are major contributors to air pollution, China and India have not been required to sign the Kyoto protocol because they are considered developing countries.
The pact, to be called the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate, will join as partners nations that together account for more than 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, said the official, who spoke anonymously so as not to pre-empt the formal announcement.
The agreement will be a major item on the agenda this week at the summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations now under way in Vientiane, the official said.
The deputy secretary of state, Robert Zoellick, who is representing the Bush administration at the conference, is scheduled to arrive Wednesday.
The aim of the pact will be to curb greenhouse emissions without hurting economic growth in the region, the official said.
Instead of mandatory targets, the new pact would aim to use the latest technologies to limit emissions and would try to make sure the technologies were available to countries that need them most, the official said.
The members of the new grouping would include some of the world's major coal producers and exporters: China, South Korea and Australia.
ON CLIMATE CHANGE, A CHANGE OF THINKING
In December 1997, representatives of most of the world's nations met in Kyoto, Japan, to negotiate a binding agreement to cut emissions of "greenhouse" gases.
They succeeded.
The Kyoto Protocol was ultimately ratified by 156 countries.
It was the first agreement of its kind.
But it may also prove to be the last.
Now, in the middle of new global warming talks in Montreal, there is a sense that the whole idea of global agreements to cut greenhouse gases won't work.
A major reason the optimism over Kyoto has eroded so rapidly is that its major requirement -- that 38 participating industrialized countries cut their greenhouse emissions below 1990 levels by the year 2012 -- was seen as just a first step toward increasingly aggressive cuts.
But the current stalemate is not just because of the inadequacies of the protocol.
It is also a response to the world's ballooning energy appetite, which, largely because of economic growth in China, has exceeded almost everyone's expectations.
And there are still no viable alternatives to fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases.
Then, too, there is a growing recognition of the economic costs incurred by signing on to the Kyoto Protocol.
This is as true, in different ways, in developed nations with high unemployment, like Germany and France, as it is in Russia, which said last week that it may have spot energy shortages this winter.
The basic template came out of the first international pact intended to protect the atmosphere, the 1987 Montreal Protocol for eliminating chemicals that harmed the ozone layer, said Richard A.Benedick, the Reagan administration's chief representative in the talks leading to that agreement.
That agreement was a success, but a misleading one in the context of climate.
While it was relatively easy to phase out ozone-harming chemicals, called chlorofluorocarbons, which were made by a handful of companies in a few countries, taking on carbon dioxide, the main climate threat, was a completely different matter, he said.
Carbon dioxide is generated by activities as varied as surfing the Web, driving a car, burning wood or flying to Montreal.
Its production is woven into the fabric of an industrial society, and, for now, economic growth is inconceivable without it.
Developing countries -- China and India being only the most dramatic examples -- want to burn whatever energy they need, in whatever form available, to grow their economies and raise the living standard of their people.
All this has turned the Montreal meeting, many participants have conceded, into, at best, a preliminary meeting on how to start over in addressing the threat of global warming.
Indeed, from here on, progress on climate is less likely to come from mega-conferences like the one in Montreal and more likely from focused initiatives by clusters of countries with common interests, said Benedick, who is now a consultant and president of the National Council on Science and the Environment, a private group promoting science-based environmental policies.
The only real answer at the moment is still far out on the horizon: nonpolluting energy sources.
"The train is not leaving the station, and it needs to leave the station," Richels said.
"If we don't have the technologies available at that time, it's going to be a mess."
IN RARE LEGAL PROTEST, CHINESE SEEK BOYCOTT OF JAPAN GOODS
The mostly college-age Chinese, singing China's national anthem and shouting, "Support the Chinese motherland, boycott Japanese goods," appeared to number in the thousands, but there were no official estimates on Saturday morning.
The police formed a cordon around the marchers and lined every street along the parade route, but the protest had been authorized in advance and the atmosphere remained relaxed.
China's government almost never allows public demonstrations, but officials made an exception to allow people to express their anger at Japan after a series of political and territorial disputes between the two countries generated widespread popular outrage.
We will stand up and defend ourselves.
Political ties between China and Japan have become strained over rival claims to a string of tiny islands in the East China Sea, where both countries have taken steps to exploit reserves of natural gas.
Beijing objected to recent moves by Japan and the United States to expand military cooperation and sharply criticized the two nations for pledging jointly to defend Taiwan if China were to attack it.
Japan has often criticized China for fanning the flames of nationalism by ignoring the changes Japan has made since the war and encouraging hatred of Japan in the state-controlled media.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
The Chinese Communist Party emphasizes its nationalist credentials and often allows civilian groups to organize activities directed against foreign nations viewed as encroaching on China's interests.
This has led to charges that China fans xenophobia to shore up support for the Communist Party.
Police occasionally allow small anti-Japan protests in front of Japan's embassy in Beijing.
But Saturday's demonstration was by some estimates the largest to be held in the capital since a massive outpouring an anti-American sentiment in 1999, after the United States bombed China's embassy in Belgrade during the war against Serbia.
Washington said the bombing was a mistake.
The main purpose of the latest protest was to appeal for Chinese to stop buying Japanese goods.
It is unclear how much impact such appeals will have on a society awash in Japanese goods.
The Zhongguancun area where the protests took place is filled with stores selling Sony televisions and camcorders, Canon printers and Toshiba computers.
Some protesters said they had the responsibility to raise awareness of Japan's past crimes and compared their current campaign to the May 4, 1919, movement, which also protested the actions of Japan and other foreign powers seen as encroaching on Chinese territory.
"This is our May 4 movement," said Wei Bing, a graduate student in computer sciences.
The legacy of that May 4 event has been a double-edged sword for the authorities.
Intense nationalist passion has often been turned against China's domestic government if it is viewed as too weak or corrupt to defend Chinese interests.
THOUSANDS IN CHINA RALLY AGAINST JAPAN FOR SECOND WEEKEND
Thousands of anti-Japan demonstrators protested in at least two Chinese cities on Saturday morning as authorities sent urgent warnings that popular protests like those authorized by Beijing a week ago now threatened to get out of control.
Several thousand people took part in a peaceful march on Saturday down one of Shanghai's main thoroughfares toward the Japanese Consulate while a slightly smaller number were reported to have formed a rally in the nearby city of Hangzhou.
Protesters smashed windows and damaged the signs of Japanese-style noodle shops and bars in Shanghai's central shopping district, The Associated Press reported.
It wasn't clear whether anyone was injured.
As hundreds of police officers and paramilitary troops in riot gear filled streets in Beijing's main embassy district and around Tiananmen Square, there were no signs that plans for protests in the capital had come to fruition.
Internet bulletins boards and cell phone text messages sent nationwide called for anti-Japan rallies in as many as 21 cities this weekend, while others promoted protest marches on sensitive anniversary dates in May and June.
"Express your patriotic passion in an orderly manner," the Beijing police said in a statement posted on the Internet on Friday.
The statement said that all street protests must be approved in advance and warned that violators would be punished according to the law.
Unrest of any kind could open the door for people to rally against government corruption and land seizures, or to complain about economic inequality or political repression.
He said government critics had already begun to take advantage of a rare easing of tight political controls.
"It can help the government gain support, but it can also help people who see the government as part of the problem," he said.
The timing is also sensitive because the Japanese foreign minister, Nobutaka Machimura, will be in China on Sunday and Monday.
The Japanese Embassy warned its citizens living in China to avoid the sites of proposed demonstrations.
Many anti-Japan Web sites have been blocked in recent days as authorities have sought to reassert control over public discourse.
A circular sent to companies and government agencies in Shanghai on Friday called on managers to ensure that their employees obeyed regulations on protesting.
Despite such cautions, detailed notices of rallies planned for Shanghai and Hangzhou on Saturday remained widely accessible online.
One lengthy Internet posting listed dos and don'ts for a Shanghai protest planned for Saturday morning, including lists of approved slogans and an appeal "not to carry any Japanese cameras or other electronic goods."
CHINESE INTENSIFY PROTESTS AGAINST JAPAN
One day before a high-level Japanese visit aimed at defusing rising tensions between the countries, thousands of Chinese besieged the Japanese Consulate here on Saturday in an angry daylong demonstration.
Although the demonstration had been heavily advertised for days, through Internet and mobile phone messages, and formally disallowed by the Chinese authorities, riot police officers and soldiers made no attempt to prevent vandalism as the crowd smashed windows of stores that displayed signs in Japanese, or threw large rocks at the consulate, often within arm's reach of law enforcement agents.
Asked by a reporter whether anything could be done to rein in the attack on the consulate, a Chinese officer answered, "By whom?" and then walked away as if annoyed.
Throughout a fusillade that lasted several hours, there appeared to be only one arrest.
Mass protests are rarely tolerated by the Chinese authorities, who deny even basic rights of free assembly to the population.
The lenience on Saturday in the face of widespread disorder, albeit a disorder focused tightly on Japan, provoked wry comments from many ordinary Chinese.
"They say it is fine to denounce Japan, but the government must know that people have even more serious grievances against the state of affairs in our country," said a man named Zhang, who declined to provide his full name.
"The contradictions in China are piling up, so they allow people to let off some steam.
But if people began to say what they really thought, the government would never allow it."
"In your country, people are allowed to demonstrate freely, so something like this probably wouldn't attract many people.
Saturday's demonstrations, with their heavily nationalistic overtones, were the latest spike in a steadily deteriorating climate of tension between Japan and China.
Other protesters said they had been motivated by a recent dispute between the two countries over tiny islands in a zone in the East China Sea thought to be rich in oil and gas deposits.
NO APOLOGY FROM CHINA FOR JAPAN PROTESTS
Raucous protests against Japan broke out in several Chinese cities, including Shenyang in the northeast and the thriving economic zone of Shenzhen in the south, though there seemed less damage to property than during a spree of vandalism in Shanghai on Saturday.
China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, was host to his Japanese counterpart, Nobutaka Machimura, here on a one-day visit.
" He said Japan was calling on "the Chinese government to act sincerely and promptly within international rules" to ensure the safety of its nationals in China.
Japan's Foreign Ministry press spokesman, Hatsuhisa Takashima, said in Beijing that it was "basically not believable" that Chinese police could not do more to prevent protesters from assaulting Japan's diplomatic compounds.
Relations between China and Japan have hit the lowest point in decades as the two feud over access to oil and gas reserves in the East China Sea, Japan's steps to strengthen its strategic alliance with the United States, and newly revised history textbooks that China says gloss over atrocities Japan committed when it occupied China during World War II.
China's leaders ignited a frenzy of anti-Japanese activism by permitting an online petition drive, a nationwide boycott movement, and then street demonstrations.
Beijing has used the expressions of outrage as a platform for a more confrontational approach to Japan.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said last week that China would block a Japanese bid to join the U.N. Security Council unless its neighbor apologized more sincerely and atoned for World War II-era abuses.
Some analysts say the move amounts to a diplomatic power play, with Beijing leveraging its growing economic might and unsettled emotions from the war era to assert itself as Asia's leading political power.
But at least in the short term, the streak of violence against Japanese interests has paralyzed diplomacy.
Japanese officials warn that the unrest has forced Japanese tourists and businessmen to cancel visits to China and say that broader damage to economic relations, which had been thriving, could not be ruled out.
"It is possible that Japan-China relations as a whole, including on the economic front, could decline to a serious state," Machimura said as he left Tokyo for Beijing on Sunday.
At his meeting with Li, he proposed that a joint commission review the war history, which Japanese officials said Li promised to consider.
But there appeared to be no breakthroughs.
Chinese and Japanese leaders have not made reciprocal state visits since 1999, a fact that some experts say has seriously hindered communication.
Japanese officials said that Hu Jintao, China's top leader, and Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, might meet on the sidelines of an international conference in Indonesia this week.
The anti-Japan protests have now continued longer than any major public demonstrations in China since the democracy uprising of 1989, which led to a bloody crackdown.
The authorities have deployed thousands of regular police and paramilitary troops in Beijing and other cities, but they have not intervened to prevent protests from becoming violent.
On Saturday, the authorities in Shanghai, China's wealthiest city, allowed as many as 20,000 people to march through arteries, tear up Japanese restaurants, upturn Japanese cars and pelt the Japanese Consulate with rocks and bottles for hours.
Smaller gatherings continued Sunday in Nanning, capital of Guangxi province, as well as Shenyang and Shenzhen, and police handled them in a similar fashion.
It is unclear how long authorities will allow protests to continue.
A massive show of force around Beijing on Sunday -- dozens and army transport vehicles and police buses surrounded Tiananmen Square and the main embassy district -- prevented large-scale demonstrations in the capital during Machimura's visit, suggesting they might be starting to tighten the reins.
CHINESE OFFICIAL ORDERS END TO ANTI-JAPANESE DEMONSTRATIONS
The minister, Li Zhaoxing, told a meeting of the Communist Party's propaganda department attended by 3,500 people that government, military, and party officials, as well as "the masses," should stay off the streets, state media reported.
"Cadres and the masses must believe in the party and the government's ability to properly handle all issues linked to Sino-Japanese relations," Li was quoted as saying.
"Calmly, rationally, and legally express your own views.
Li's comments, carried on national television, amounted to the first direct call by a top official to wind down the protests by tens of thousands of urban residents.
The demonstrations have continued on three successive weekends, becoming China's most sustained street protests since the pro-democracy uprising of 1989.
Until now, the protests have enjoyed at least tacit approval from the central government.
Although none of the major marches in Beijing, Shanghai, and several other cities received formal permits, the police had not made consistent efforts to prevent them or to arrest people responsible for vandalizing Japanese diplomatic missions or private property in the marches.
But his appeal to rein in the protests likely reflects the views of top leaders, who may have concluded that little is to be gained from further protests and that social stability is at some risk if they continue unchecked.
The suggestion that officials must "resolutely implement" leadership decisions hints at a possible divergence of opinions over how to manage the protests.
In communist history, unclear or contradictory orders from the top have often provided an opening for public protests and made the police reluctant to exert their authority.
It is unclear if elements in the leadership structure had different views this time, but Li implied that lower level officials would be held responsible for carrying out the new mandate.
(STORY CAN END HERE.

The big test of the order will come next week.
Urban residents have been sending text and e-mail messages to one another calling for major marches on May 1, China's traditional Labor Day, and on May 4.
May 4 is particularly significant in Chinese history because it is the anniversary of the first major student-led nationalist uprising in 1919.
Popular outrage over the Versailles Treaty, which gave German-controlled territory in China to Japan after World War I, sparked that protest.
Authorities generally step up surveillance and harassment of critics of the government on such anniversaries to guard against unrest.
JAPAN STEPS UP CRITICISM OF CHINA
With China refusing to apologize for anti-Japanese protests, Japan's leadership stepped up criticism of Beijing on Tuesday, even as Japan's population seemed to back a more cautious stance.
"Each country has its own history, tradition, and different views," he said.
Hardliners in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have drowned out isolated criticism of Koizumi.
"People are expected to offer an apology and compensation if they damage other people's property," Shoichi Nakagawa, the minister of economy, trade, and industry, said.

BY PLAYING AT 'RAGE,' CHINA DRAMATIZES ITS RISE
The banners had been carefully printed, the slogans memorized, and the students and young unleashed onto the streets of China's largest, most sophisticated city, where they were to speak sacred truths and make the enemies of the people tremble.
Chinese today have little experience of mass organized protests, so when the government tolerated -- some would say encouraged -- a huge anti-Japanese demonstration here that flirted with turning into a riot over the weekend, for many it bore echoes of the mass manipulation of students of another era, the Cultural Revolution.
For hours on Saturday, thousands of Chinese, from teenagers to people in their 30s, lay siege to the Japanese consulate in this city, smashing its windows and defacing its walls with a copious rain of rocks and bottles.
But for all the expressions of anger against Japan by people far too young to have memories of China's brutal subjugation by its neighbor, at its most basic level this was a festival of runaway nationalism, of a government-nurtured Chinese-ness.
Declaring themselves to be all one people, the demonstrators proclaimed their love of the police who escorted them as they marched to the consulate, smashing Japanese shops along the way.
Banners extolled Chinese greatness, in contrast to little Japan; chanters called for their homeland to stand tall; and talk was dominated by Chinese "feelings," a word repeated over and over, as if no other feelings counted.
They were old enough to remember just how badly things can go when intoxication is the order of the day, and laws are swept aside by feelings.
"I watched the police cars escorting the demonstrators and felt this all looked familiar, like an official event in the Cultural Revolution, but those drew bigger crowds and were more emotional," said Zhu Xueqin, a historian at Shanghai University who emerged from a public library to watch the march go by.
"I observed it as a bystander, and the people observing around me looked indifferent, seemingly full of reservations."
Shanghai is the most dazzling symbol of a China that has changed so much since the Cultural Revolution as to be almost unrecognizable.
But in some important ways, most notably the government's will to control information and through it people's minds, the events of the weekend here and their aftermath show that this country has barely changed at all.
The Maoist slogans of 40 years ago have been replaced by anti-Japanese watchwords, and then as now, few of those caught up in the excitement paused to examine the relationship of today's slogans to the truth.
Here were students mouthing such claims as "Japan has never apologized to China," or "Japanese textbooks whitewash history.
" Many Japanese textbooks have recently de-emphasized atrocities committed in China, and some have been widely distributed.
But in China, the most tendentious of them is the one cited as a representative sample, although it is used by less than 1 percent of Japanese schools.
Never mind that for over two decades, Japan has been a leading source of development assistance for China -- to the tune of $30 billion in low interest loans -- helping build everything from Shanghai's futuristic airport to expensive highway and water systems in the country's vast, impoverished west.
Few in the Chinese crowds, including many educated in the country's best schools, seemed aware of facts like those, or of any other side to the story save what could be fit into the dichotomy of a China that is essentially good and a Japan that is predatory, evil, conniving or, in a word heard over and over, "disgusting."
Like anything that involves information in China, this ignorance seems the result of careful planning.
Since diplomatic relations between the two countries were normalized in 1972, for example, Japanese officials have apologized numerous times to China for the suffering their country inflicted in the 20th century.
In 1995 on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, for example, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama spoke of the " tremendous damage and suffering" his country had caused, adding "I regard, in a spirit of humanity, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology."
But China's state-controlled media have usually focused on finding fault with each Japanese pronouncement, sustaining the belief that Japan has indeed never apologized.
The largest question, perhaps, is why China would so carefully sustain anger at Japan.
One possibility is that in recent years, the legitimacy of China's leadership has rested on few things so much as the idea of inevitability -- a destined ascension of the country to prosperous world-power status and a return to the unquestioned pre-eminence in the East that it enjoyed before the 20th century.
In this picture there is little room for Japan, a country that has derailed China's ambitions before, and suddenly seems unwilling to fade.
By midweek, signs were multiplying that China's leaders were rethinking their confrontation with Japan, at least at the level of public relations.
With the ugliness toward their neighbor threatening a loss of international sympathy on other issues, China first reportedly made a quiet offer to repair Japan's damaged consulate, and on Tuesday urged an end to demonstrations.
(STORY CAN END HERE.

Left aside in the weekend's atmospherics and the effort to dispel them was the question of whether China has done a better job teaching history than its neighbor.
In the West, it is accepted as fact that more Chinese were killed by the policies of Mao Zedong than by the Japanese, including many by summary execution and other atrocities that are glossed over in Chinese textbooks.
In those books, Mao is still treated with reverence.
China also claims never to have seized territory from a neighbor, but China attacked India by surprise in 1962 and the details of other campaigns, from Korea and Xinjiang in the north to Vietnam and Tibet in the country's south and west, are also absent from textbooks.
More remarkable than any glance at the receding past, however, was the way news of the anti-Japanese demonstrations has been treated in China in the here and now.
Chinese authorities televised notices that the protests had not been approved on the eve of Saturday's anti-Japanese demonstration, which served as much as anything else as an announcement of the event.
The news the next day avoided all mention of disorder.
Similarly there were no images of young people pelting the Japanese consulate at their leisure, within arm's reach of paramilitary police.
The seeming contradictions in all of this were not lost on all Chinese, however.
Discussions have raged all week on the Internet, with many questioning their countrymen's behavior and the government's permissiveness toward anti-Japanese violence.
"You call yourselves patriotic? Patriotic what?"
CHINA MOVES TO CRACK DOWN ON PROTESTS AGAINST JAPAN
"We don't expect the economic and trade relations between the two countries to be infringed upon," Bo was quoted as saying by the official New China News Agency.
The harder tone by the Communist Party was in marked contrast to its stance for much of April as the government allowed protests to erupt across the country.
This week, China and Japan have both moved to prevent a deeper diplomatic crisis.
The shift also suggests that China has concluded that it cannot allow public anger to escalate further.
During the protests, police officers conspicuously did not intervene when protesters in Beijing threw bottles at the Japanese Embassy or when marchers in Shanghai vandalized Japanese businesses -- a passivity interpreted by some analysts as tacit encouragement by the government.
But with the Internet filled with rumors of more protests planned for May, the government has now closed anti-Japanese Web sites that had been promoting the marches.
A Ministry of Public Security spokesman said any future marches would be illegal without a government permit.
None of the previous marches had permits.
Japan had called on China to apologize for the vandalism and reimburse Japanese citizens for any property damage.
Thousands of university students participated in the protests, and the government this week sent a group of former Chinese diplomats on a "speech tour" to colleges in six cities where protests had been held.
State media reported that the tour is to help students "correctly understand" the importance of friendly coexistence between the two countries.
Many youthful Chinese are strongly anti-Japanese, and critics say the country's education system distorts history and demonizes Japan while whitewashing the darker periods of the Communist Party's own history.
The police took the harder line after Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing on Tuesday made the government's first public appeal to end the protests so that diplomats could solve the crisis.
State media outlets, which often take a starkly anti-Japanese position, have shifted tone this week and are now placing greater emphasis on the need for comity between the two Asian powers.
PROTESTERS OUTFLANKED GOVERNMENT CENSORS
The thousands of people who poured onto the streets of China this month for anti-Japanese protests were bound by nationalist anger but also by a more mundane fact: They are China's cell phone and computer generation.
As the protests grew larger and more unruly, China banned almost all coverage in the state media.
But it hardly mattered.
An underground conversation was raging via e-mail, text message and instant online messaging that inflamed public opinion and served as an organizing tool.
Last Friday the government banned the use of text messages or e-mail messages to organize protests.
"They are afraid the Chinese people will think, 'OK, today we protest Japan; tomorrow, Japan,"' said one Asian diplomat who has watched the protests closely.
"But the day after tomorrow, how about we protest against the government?"
Few countries censor communications as tightly as China, which has as many as 50,000 people policing the Internet.
Yet China is now the largest cell phone market, with nearly 350 million users, while the number of Internet users is roughly 100 million.
The result is a constant tension between a population hungry for freer communication and a government that regards information control as essential to its power.
Anti-Japanese protesters have been able to spread information and loosely coordinate different marches in a country where political organizing is illegal.
"Chain letter" e-mail messages and text messages urged people to boycott Japanese products or sign online petitions opposing Japanese ascension to the U.N. Security Council.
Information about protests, including marching routes, was posted online or forwarded by e-mail messages.
Banned video images of protest violence in Shanghai could be downloaded off the Internet.
In Shanghai, local police even sent out a mass text message to cell phone users on the day before that city's raucous protest.
"We ask people to express your patriotic passion through the right channel, follow the laws and maintaining order," the message said.
Some marchers interpreted the message as a signal to proceed, while other people took it as a warning.
In the past, the government has shown it can tighten monitoring of these technologies.
Security officials are thought to be able to track a person's whereabouts by intercepting cell phone transmissions.
One reason is that a growing number of young Chinese have multiple e-mail accounts, including with providers based outside China that are not filtered.
EXPERTS SUSPECT AL-QAIDA ALLY IN LONDON ATTACKS
Little is known about the "Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe," the group that claimed responsibility for Thursday's terror attacks in London.
What terror experts do know is the attacks have all the markings of terrorists who use the tactics of al-Qaida's leader Osama bin Laden.
The four blasts that rocked London were well-coordinated, timed for a major political event and aimed at undermining the economy.
But it is unclear how connected, if at all, the group is to the upper reaches of al-Qaida.
If a group labels itself al-Qaida, it doesn't necessarily mean that bin Laden is giving it orders, said Michael Swetnam, founder of the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank based in Virginia.
The group that struck London probably acted independently of al-Qaida's top leaders in the same way that the bombers who attacked commuter trains in Madrid last March acted without the direct support of bin Laden, Swetnam said.
"It's a different group, different set of guys, but exactly the same modus operandi," said Swetnam, who also advises the Senate Intelligence Committee on terrorism.
"It fits to a T the way al-Qaida works."
The terrorists' goal behind the London bombings likely was to punish Britain for its close relationship with America and its involvement in Iraq, said Milton Bearden, a retired senior C.I.A.official who was the agency's ranking officer in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Sudan.
He, too, draws a parallel to the Madrid bombings that killed 191 people.
Al-Qaida was immediately blamed for the attacks.
Both news organizations published the text on their Web sites, according to the Associated Press.
The radical Islamic Web site has since been taken down.
Since its inception in the late 1980s, Al-Qaida has always been a loosely connected group of terrorist organizations.
But in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, those connections became even more tenuous, according to terror experts.
As the number of Muslims grow in Europe they face racism and a lack of hope for the future.

TIMERS USED IN BLASTS, POLICE SAY; PARALLELS TO MADRID FOUND
Don Van Natta Jr.reported from London for this article and Elaine Sciolino from Paris.
Reporting was contributed by David Johnston, David E. Sanger and Scott Shane in Washington, Stephen Grey in London, Tim Golden in New York and Souad Mekhennet in Frankfurt, Germany.
LONDON -- Investigators searching for clues in the attacks here said Thursday that the three bombs used in the Underground appeared to have been detonated by timers, not suicide bombers, and that a fourth device may have been intended for a target other than the city bus that it destroyed.
Senior police officials said they had not received a message claiming responsibility for the attacks from any group, and had made no arrests.
But officials immediately drew parallels between the London bombings and the ones that struck commuter trains in Madrid, Spain, 16 months ago, which were carried out by a Qaida-inspired cell.
By Thursday night, there were far more questions than answers confronting Scotland Yard.
One official said none of the scores of suspected terrorists watched closely in England appeared to be involved.
Police and intelligence officials acknowledged they were taken completely by surprise by the coordinated bombings, even though they had been anticipating a terrorist attack for years.
The officials said there was no warning or even a hint that an attack was imminent among the blizzard of intelligence accumulated in recent days by the Metropolitan Police and MI5, the domestic intelligence services.
"There was no intelligence in our possession that these attacks were going to take place today," said Brian Paddick, deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.
"We were given no warning from any organization that this was going to happen."
Since Sept. 11, 2001, senior police officials have warned that a large-scale terror attack in Britain was not a matter of if but when, a prediction repeated by a senior police official late last month.
The Joint Terrorist Analysis Center reduced the threat level of a terrorist attack from "severe general" to "substantial" early last month.
There are seven levels to the security scale, with severe general the third most severe and substantial the fourth.
The threat levels are not made public, but they reflect the intelligence on potential attacks and help officials to make decisions about staff levels.
The alert level was not raised to coincide with the opening of the Group of 8 summit meeting in Scotland, officials said.
Paddick and other police officials denied that the lower ranking affected the level of the emergency response to the bombings on Thursday morning.
He also rejected the suggestion that the ranking reflected a conclusion that the terrorist threat had eased here.
Michael Mates, a senior member of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said, "There was certainly a heightened awareness this week, although it's likely that resources were a bit more focused on the G-8 summit."
Upon his return to London on Thursday afternoon, Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed that the authorities would mount "the most intense police and security investigation to bring those responsible to justice."
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the explosions bore "the hallmarks of an al-Qaida-related attack," but police officials stopped short of assigning any blame to a particular group.
A group calling itself the Secret Organization of al-Qaida in Europe announced on a Web site that it was responsible for the bombings.
The announcement also threatened Italy and Denmark, which have provided troops to the U.S.-led coalition fighting in Iraq.
U.S. intelligence officials said they had begun a detailed review of data gathered in the weeks before Thursday's attacks in London to search for possible clues.
"Everybody's going back and looking over their reporting to see if we overlooked anything or failed to share it," one senior intelligence official said.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Counterterrorism officials in London said they were still trying to determine the type of explosives that were used.
One official said speculated that the No.30 bus whose roof was blown off at 9:47 a.m. in Bloomsbury was demolished accidentally by a suicide bomber.
But another theory gaining momentum was that the bomb exploded prematurely as a bomber was carrying it to an intended target, several U.S. and British counterterrorism officials said.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
The officials said that the three subway bombs appeared to have been detonated by timers, not cell phones or other remote triggers.
The bombs on the trains were believed to be package bombs and are believed to have been left by attackers who fled before they went off.
Officials refused to confirm or deny reports that two unexploded package bombs were recovered from trains.
A senior U.S. intelligence official said that the British had conducted "at least one controlled explosion" of a suspicious package found after the attacks, but said he could not confirm that the package was another bomb.
The bombings in Madrid and London were separated by 16 months, but the attacks on the two major capital cities in the heart of Europe bear eerie similarities, as well as grim lessons for counterterrorism officials.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Like Madrid, the attacks on London were aimed not at symbols of power like Big Ben or Westminster Abbey, but at the mundane: ordinary workers making their way to work at the busiest time of the day.
In Madrid, 191 people were killed when 10 bombs ripped through four commuter trains during the morning rush hour.
The effect in both cities was to paralyze the ordinary workings of the city.
British authorities announced that every inch of every subway train in London would be examined to insure that no more explosives had been planted, just as Spanish authorities examined every commuter train wreck.
"The explosions were designed to elicit panic among the people," said Gen.Hamidou Laanigri, Morocco's chief of security, in a telephone interview.
Another similarity is that politics may have played a role in the timing.
Thursday was the first day of the G-8 summit, hosted by Blair at Gleneagles, near Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the time of the bombings in Madrid, Spain was only three days away from a close national election.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Both Spain and Britain sent troops to aid the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the military attack in Afghanistan, although it is not known whether support for U.S. foreign policies played a role in the London attack.
British and Spanish intelligence services are operating on the assumption that a network with allegiance to al-Qaida -- either Arabs or one of the emerging Pakistani groups in Europe -- was responsible for the London attacks, several intelligence officials said.
"It is still too early to definitively say who carried out these attacks," said Matt Levitt, a former FBI agent and now a senior fellow and director of terrorism studies at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
"But as the investigation into the London bombings proceeds, authorities should not be surprised if the evidence reveals a more critical link to the Madrid attacks."
Senior counterterrorism officials say al-Qaida has evolved from a structured, hierarchical group to a decentralized organization that relies on small, independent groups to carry out attacks.
"There have been a lot of attempts" in London, said Baltasar Garzon, a Spanish judge who has investigated al-Qaida for years.
"And in this case, they finally hit some of the easiest targets with these trains.
Their only real obstacle to this kind of action is getting the explosives.
Once they have them, it's very easy to attack targets like Sunday trains."
Mates, of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said it had been only a matter of time before a coordinated attack struck London.
He said the authorities had thwarted at least three coordinated attacks in London since Sept. 11.
"We've caught and prevented those who were trying to get through and stopped them," he said.
(STORY CAN END HERE.

Britain has considerable experience investigating bombs and identifying those responsible, based on years of attacks in London and in Northern Ireland by the Irish Republican Army.
Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Osama bin Laden and other groups have threatened to attack Britain in retaliation for its support of the United States.
Last April, bin Laden demanded that Britain and other U.S. allies pull out of Iraq by July 15, 2004.
The deadline passed without incident.
The Underground and most public streets are monitored by a vast network of closed-circuit television cameras, whose images were being reviewed Thursday by investigators.
They also hoped to recover DNA samples from bombs and body fragments.
All those arrested in Britain must provide DNA samples, even if they do not face criminal charges.
POLICE VOW TO TRACK DOWN TERRORISTS BEHIND LONDON BOMBINGS
The London police on Friday promised a massive investigation to find the people behind Thursday morning's coordinated terror attack on the London transit system that has left at least 50 dead and 700 people wounded.
"And that is something that we will bend every sinew of the Metropolitan Police and all our associated agencies and comrades to do."
Four explosions in central London detonated within 18 minutes during rush hour Thursday at three subway stations, and less than an hour later, tore apart a red double-decker bus.
Prime Minister Tony Blair said the attacks appeared to have been timed to disrupt the meeting of the Group of Eight summit meeting in Scotland.
The blasts shut down the city's bus and subway system, which by Friday morning, had been resumed on most routes.
Ten of London's 12 subway lines reopened Friday, though service on at least three of the lines was restricted.
Bus service was diverted around blast sites.
Officials have said that the bombings bore the trademark of an al-Qaida attack.
Police raised the official death toll Friday morning from 37 to 50, and said that of the approximately 700 injured, about 22 are in serious and critical condition in hospitals.
About 350 others were treated at the scene and about 100 were released after being hospitalized overnight.
Ian Blair, the London police commissioner, said workers had not yet reached the dead aboard a train in the tunnel near the King's Cross station where at least 21 died.
Authorities asked for patience, saying it was unclear how soon they would reach the bodies, given the possibility of tunnel collapse and rats.
"It would be totally unwise," said Andy Hayman, assistant London police commissioner.
"If we rushed this particular stage."
Hayman said the four bombs that were detonated each weighed less than 10-lbs., which could have fit inside a rucksack.
Police said the bombs that exploded on the trains had likely been placed on the floor, while it is unclear where the bomb on the bus had been placed.
Officials also said that it was too early to tell how they had been detonated.
They said there was no evidence of a suicide bomber.
BOMB EVIDENCE SIGNALS A LOW-TECH OPERATION
Investigators have concluded that the bombs that ripped through three subway trains and a bus on Thursday were relatively crude devices containing less than 10 pounds of explosives each.
That finding supports a theory gaining momentum among the authorities that the plot was carried out by a sleeper cell of homegrown extremists rather than highly trained terrorists exported to Britain.
Crucial facts remained unknown in the case Friday evening.
But senior British and American investigators said the morning rush-hour attack in central London appeared to have been a brutally low-tech operation, less expertly conceived than the cell phone-triggered train bombings in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, which killed 191 people and injured more than 1,800
For example, although there were at least 49 deaths and 700 wounded in the London bombings, the death toll might have been much higher had the attack been carried out by experts -- given the large numbers of commuters who were crowded into the transit system.
There may be other signs that an inexperienced sleeper cell was at work, investigators said.
The bombings have so far produced very few leads or possible suspects among the known extremist groups and cells in Britain and the rest of Europe.
That could mean, the investigators said, that the bombers never crossed paths with authorities and may have not been associated with known extremist groups in the past.
Some of the authorities cautioned, though, that the investigation was continuing and the focus on a homegrown sleeper cell could shift as evidence developed.
British and American officials said they were hopeful they would soon get a big break in the case, which they said would probably come from the forensic analysis at the scenes or the images captured by the closed-circuit television cameras, known as CCTV, installed throughout the London subway system.
Andy Trotter, deputy chief constable of British Transport Police, said a large-scale operation was under way to search the camera tapes for images of the suspects.
"If they weren't suicide bombers, then they must have got on and off these trains," he said.
"That means their pictures can be grabbed from CCTV cameras.
The Underground network is a CCTV-rich environment and so this is going to be an intense investigation to look at the images."
Trotter said the images of the terrorists might also have been captured by cameras as they walked on the sidewalk entering or leaving the subway stations.
Most central London streets are covered by cameras whose images are recorded on tape.
In an interview on Friday, Gary M. Bald, the FBI's chief of counterintelligence and counterterrorism, would not discuss specifics of the bombing case, but said the bureau had increased personnel in its London liaison office from about six people to about a dozen.
Referring to a possible attack on a mass transit system in Europe or the United States, he said, "We have known that terrorists' groups possess the capability to carry out this type of attack," he said.
"This has been a concern for some time.
As a painstaking search of the four crime scenes goes on, forensic experts are focusing sharply on the twisted wreckage of one of London's signature double-decker buses, where one of the bombs exploded toward the rear of its second floor near Tavistock Square in the Bloomsbury section of London.
Crime scene specialists are conducting DNA swabs in an attempt to identify the bus bomber by looking for a match DNA samples in databases maintained by Britain and other countries.
The bus bombing is also considered by investigators to be another clue of an amateurish terror attack.
They say they are almost certain that the blast was a mistimed explosion caused when the bomber accidentally detonated the device as it was being transported to its intended target.
Two wounded survivors have told a hospital doctor of a young man, possibly in his 20s, getting on board the bus, but then frantically rummaging through a bag before it exploded.
Another passenger, Richard Jones, a 61-year-old computer consultant, told The Daily Mail that he had seen a man in his mid-20s become "extremely agitated" shortly after sitting down.
"This chap started digging down into his bag and getting back up," said Jones, who left the bus moments before it exploded.
"He did it about a dozen times in two or three minutes and looked extremely agitated."
The search for important evidence includes an effort to locate the bomber's remains and possibly identification cards that he might have carried.
The three other bombs were timed to detonate a short time after each train left the King's Cross station.
Senior police officials said Friday that the bombers left the package bombs on the floor of the trains, hopping off as the doors of the cars were closing.
In each case, the bombs exploded roughly 100 to 150 yards down the tracks from the platform.
The Madrid bombings also used small-size explosive devices, though they averaged 22 pounds each and were detonated within a three-minute period on 10 commuter trains.
Each of the Madrid bombs was detonated by the use of the alarm function on cell phones.
A similar detonation system is believed to have been used in the London attacks.
"We believe the explosives were detonated in London by some kind of timing device," the official said, "though at this stage we cannot say if it was a mobile phone or not."
Although their most active theory is that the London bombings were planned and executed by a Britain-based sleeper cell, the authorities are also investigating whether European, north African or Pakistani elements played a role.
Investigators said they wanted to question Zeeshan Haider, 25, a British national arrested in May near Peshawar, in the restive North-West Frontier province.
He is being held by the Pakistani authorities.
"There is no evidence right now to link him up to the bombings in London and everything seems presumptuous," a Pakistani intelligence official said.
"Part of their thinking is the cell chose a predominantly Muslim neighborhood to launch these attacks," the official added.
"The bombers might have thought it would make it easier for them to leave the stations and blend in."
More bodies were expected to be found in the train tunnel near Russell Square station.
The police declined to say how many bodies remained in the subway, but it might be as many as a dozen, one official said.
The work was hampered by a partially collapsed tunnel that blocked access to the blown apart train.
Industrial-strength air coolers were brought into the tunnel to keep the air cool, officials said.
"The train is down a tunnel and it is a very deep line at this point.
We've had to bring in some heavy ventilation equipment.
The operation involves both the recover of bodies and also forensic work.
It's just too early to say how long it's going to take."
Bald said that were as yet no indication from the London bombing that the United States was under increased threat of attack, he said, although he cautioned that targets like New York and Washington, like London, remain high on al-Qaida's target list.
He said that terrorism officials had long been aware of the possibility of a mass transit bombing, especially since the March 2004 attacks in Madrid.
But he cautioned that the investigation may alter that conclusion.
INVESTIGATORS ID FOUR ATTACKERS, POSSIBLY ALL BRITISH-BORN; AT LEAST TWO OF THEM DIED IN BLASTS
After dramatic raids Tuesday on six houses in the northern city of Leeds, Scotland Yard investigators said they had identified the four men who detonated the bombs that claimed the lives of at least 52 London commuters last week.
Police said that at least two, and possibly all four, of the men died in the attacks, an indication that they were the first suicide bombers to strike Britain, bringing the deadly tactics often used in Israel and Iraq to Western Europe.
The raids by police and soldiers in a mixed-race neighborhood in Leeds suggested that the bombers were British-born young men who had been radicalized.
The police arrested a man identified by the Press Association wire service as a relative of one of the bombers.
After finding a significant amount of explosives in one of the homes that was searched, officials evacuated about 600 people from the neighborhood.
Heavily armed police surrounded the house and used a controlled explosion to get inside.
Police said Tuesday night that they found explosives in a car parked at the railroad station in Luton, a small city north of London with a large Muslim population.
The name of the arrested man and those of the bombers were not released.
Scotland Yard kept many details of the operation secret.
The police did not say whether they believe the four bombers concocted the plan or were recruited by others who have not been apprehended.
Police said the crucial clue came 90 minutes after the near simultaneous blasts during Thursday's morning rush hour when the parents of one of the young men called a special casualty line to report that their son was missing.
It turned out, police said, that the man was the bomber who detonated an explosive device on a double-decker bus, killing 13 people.
Like many throughout Britain, his parents were frantically trying to locate a missing loved one in the chaotic hours after the explosions.
Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yard's Anti-Terrorist Branch, said Tuesday that personal property belonging to this man was found at the bus blast scene, and that personal property from the other three men was found at the other blast sites, providing physical evidence tying them to the terror attacks.
He said the papers were personal documents bearing the names of the suspected bombers.
"The investigation led us to have concerns about the movements and activities of four men, three of whom came from the West Yorkshire area," he said, referring to the city of Leeds.
"We are trying to establish their movements in the runup to last week's attacks, and specifically to establish if they all died in the explosions."
The fourth man apparently came from Luton and met up with the other three at King's Cross station, a major transport hub in northeast London.
Police said the bus bomber and the man who bombed the Circle Line subway at the Aldgate station have died.
The police also said it is possible that the two other bombers also may have blown themselves up.
Magnus Ranstorp, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at St. Andrews University in Scotland, said after the police new conference that Thursday's attacks represent a nightmare-come-true for British authorities, who have long warned that the capital city is vulnerable to terror attacks.
"We're looking at two firsts for Europe.
On the one hand you have homegrown terrorism, and the other dimension is suicide bombings, one of the first times in Europe."
Tuesday was a day of fast-moving events in several parts of England.
In the morning, Britons were told that the investigation had failed to produce significant leads and that the search for evidence might take weeks.
The chief of Scotland Yard, Ian Blair, said another terror attack was likely although it was impossible to predict when it would occur.
This changed about 10 a.m. when police disclosed that six search warrants had been obtained overnight and that a major operation was unfolding in Leeds, about 190 miles north of London.
The city of about 750,000 people includes a large Muslim population with many Britons of Pakistani origin.
Some analysts speculated that the case might have been solved because several trains run from Leeds to London's King's Cross station, where all of the bombed subway trains passed through before the explosions.
The Leeds searches seemed to grow in importance when the area was evacuated and a controlled explosion set off.
At about the same time, police closed the railroad station in Luton and searched a car suspected of being tied to the attacks.
Explosives were found in the car Tuesday night, police said.
Police have said the bombs used Thursday consisted of high-grade explosives, and military experts believe they may have been purchased on the black market in Eastern Europe, where it is relatively easy to buy weapons with cash.

BRITISH SEEKING MAN POLICE SAY WAS TRAINED IN EXPLOSIVES Reporting for this article was contributed by Helene Fouquet in Brussels, Belgium, Douglas Jehl in Washington, Sara Lyall in Luton, William K.Rashbaum in New York and Don Van Natta Jr., Pamela Kent and Stephen Grey in London.
LONDON -- British investigators have mounted a worldwide manhunt for the suspected bomb-maker in the London attacks, a man seen on a videotape with four suspected bombers last Thursday morning at the Luton train station, an American official said Wednesday.
The four suspected bombers are seen on the closed-circuit television leaving for a London-bound train, but the fifth man, suspected as the bomb maker, stays behind.
Investigators said the man is a British citizen, as were the four suspected suicide bombers.
While he is not "Anglo," he is not of Pakistani descent, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to upstage Britain in a case the two countries are cooperating on.
The official added that British police investigators knew the man's name but had decided not to release it or his image.
This fifth man is suspected of being the ringleader and possibly the bomb maker, the U.S. official said, in the attacks in the London Underground and on a double-decker city bus that killed at least 52 people.
Investigators described him as a highly trained person.
On Wednesday, several U.S. law enforcement officials identified one of the suspected suicide bombers as a Jamaican-born British resident named Lindsey Germaine.
The other suspected bombers were of Pakistani descent and lived in the gritty working-class neighborhoods of Leeds.
Late Wednesday, the British police said officers had searched a home in Aylesbury, 40 miles northwest of London and close to Luton, but would not say whether anyone had been arrested.
The developments emerged as Charles Clarke, the British home secretary, offered the first official indication that British officials believed the four attackers were suicide bombers.
The attacks confronted Britons for the first time with a suicidal attack by British-born terrorists, apparently drawn from the ranks of disaffected Muslims and seeming to copycat attacks most Britons see only on their television screens from Israel or Iraq.
According to police accounts, the four men, ages 18 to 30, gathered at King's Cross station at the heart of the London subway system and fanned out from there, detonating explosives on three subway trains and, almost one hour later, aboard a No.30 bus.
One theory is that the men had aimed to strike at the four points of the compass on subway lines but were foiled by delays on a northbound line.
The three Underground bombs exploded south, east and west of King's Cross.
"This is not an isolated criminal act we are dealing with," Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament.
Blair said his Labor Party planned to open negotiations with other parties on new anti-terror laws.
"We will look urgently at how we strengthen the procedures to exclude people from entering the U.K. who may incite hatred or act contrary to the public good, and at how we deport such people, if they come here, more easily," Blair said.
Muslims and Christians alike have recoiled from the notion that the suspected bombers had emerged from the ranks of Britain's 1.6 million Muslims, who make up about 3 percent of the population.
"It will take us a long time to come to terms with the fact that these atrocities appear to have been committed by those who were born and brought up in our midst."
Mohammed Sarwar, a Muslim Labor member of Parliament, said, "We are deeply shocked that these are homegrown bombers, and a vast majority of the Muslim community condemn these barbaric attacks."
Investigators said authorities were concerned that despite Tuesday's raids on six homes in the Leeds area and the seizure of a car laden with explosives at Luton, some of the high-grade explosives used in the attack might still be unaccounted for.
The police said Tuesday they had seized explosives from one of the homes in Leeds, and on Wednesday night, erected scaffolding and plastic sheeting around all six and refused to allow hundreds of residents to return to nearby buildings.
Investigators were trying urgently to find out whether the bombers had contact with al-Qaida operatives, possibly in North Africa.
Since the bombings, police have given the impression that the attackers were what Clarke on Wednesday referred to as "foot soldiers," whose anonymity made it easier for them to slip through the net of the security services.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
But after a meeting of European Union interior ministers in Brussels, Nicholas Sarkozy, the French ministry, said, "It seems that part of this team had been subject to partial arrest" in the spring of 2004.
Clarke denied that any of the bombers had been arrested and released.
Sarkozy's aides scrambled later to say he had been referring to arrests among the broader Islamic movement, not the London bombers.
That puts different burdens on all of us."
"We have to understand," he continued, "that these foot soldiers who have done this are only one element of an organization that is bringing about this kind of mayhem in our society.
Pakistan's interior minister, Aftab Ahmed Khan Sheparo, said Wednesday that his country had given "information" to Britain about a possible attack before the British elections in May, but he did not elaborate.
With government ministers warning that more attackers may still be at large, many Britons have shown themselves stoic, despite a rash of security scares across the capital as police investigate apparently suspicious packages.
"We've got to look at the reasoning behind these things," said Saraj Qazi, a 25-year-old Muslim boutique owner in Luton, just north of London, where police suspect the bombers gathered for their final brief journey into the British capital on July 7.
"England is a great country and we love it to bits, but do we love this government? No," Qazi said.
"There were 24 Muslims killed in Iraq today; there will be more tonight and more tomorrow."
There have already been incidents of mosques being attacked.
Blair, who met with Muslim legislators on Wednesday, promised immediate discussions with Muslim leaders to "debate the right way forward."
But, referring to Islamic extremism, he said: "In the end this can only be taken on and defeated by the community itself."
In Parliament, Shahid Malik, a Labor legislator from the same West Yorkshire area that was home to the bombers, said condemnation of extremists was "not enough and British Muslims must, and I believe, are prepared to, confront the voices of evil head on."
The notion of more draconian anti-terror laws has raised concerns that Britain will forfeit its long-standing commitment to tolerance and civil rights in the name of a war on terror modeled on that of the U.S.
AS U.S. AND BRITAIN WEIGHED SEIZING HIM, TERROR SUSPECT ELUDED ARREST IN AFRICA
Several weeks before the July 7 bombings in London, British officials were reluctant to approve a plan by U.S. authorities to seize an Indian-born British citizen who is now wanted for questioning in the attacks, law enforcement officials said Thursday.
At the time, the man, Haroon Rashid Aswat, 31, had been under surveillance in South Africa by the authorities there, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the case.
But during discussions between the three nations about how to proceed against Aswat, who was wanted on terrorism charges brought in New York City, he eluded investigators and disappeared, the officials said.
Last week, Aswat, who came under intense scrutiny after the London bombings, was arrested in Zambia by authorities there, several officials said.
His connection to the July 7 bombings in London remains unclear.
U.S. and British officials have traveled to Zambia and are discussing with local authorities which country will take custody of him, the officials said.
Aswat, an aide to one of Britain's most militant Islamic clerics, first came under scrutiny by U.S. counterterrorism investigators in 2002 in Seattle.
But the authorities there believed he had been killed fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
In the weeks before the London bombings, South African authorities informed federal authorities in New York that Aswat was alive and living in their country, one of the officials said.
South African authorities "were watching this guy and as it turned out," one of the officials said, "somewhere along the line they lost him."
British investigators suspect that Aswat may have provided logistical support for the coordinated attacks in London's public transportation system on July 7, which killed 56 people, including the bombers, and wounded 700, several senior intelligence and law enforcement officials have said.
While Aswat has been questioned by investigators in Zambia, his statements have not shed any light on whether he played a role in the London attacks, one of the officials said.
Aswat's arrest was first reported in The Los Angeles Times.
The discussions between U.S., South African and British officials centered on the United States' desire to take custody of Aswat, in a process known as rendition, several officials said.
But British authorities, citing Aswat's British citizenship, were reluctant to approve the plan.
"The discussion was whether or not they would render him," the official said.
"He's got U.K. papers, and they said you can't render somebody with U.K. papers."
In London, the police arrested nine more men on Thursday in a widening and frantic effort to track down the subway and bus bombers involved in the second wave of attacks on July 21 before they strike again.
But none of those detained was a suspected bomber, and London's police chief warned that the three known bombers still at large or possible accomplices posed a serious threat.
"This is not the B team," the chief, Ian Blair, said about the July 21 attackers.
In a jittery city that had suffered terror attacks on two of the three preceding Thursdays, the police swarmed through the subway system on Thursday, closing one subway station and a section of a major east-west line for a period for security reasons, officials said.
The police were also hoping to learn more about the July 21 bombers, and of their possible links to the July 7 attacks, from Yasin Hassan Omar, the 24-year-old Somali man seized Wednesday in Birmingham and suspected of being one of the July 21 bombers.
Under British law, he is entitled to have a lawyer present during the interrogation.
But the man police were particularly eager to question was Aswat, once a senior aide to Abu Hamza al-Masri, the blind, one-armed militant cleric who preached fiery anti-Western sermons at the Finsbury Park mosque in northern London.
Al-Masri, who urged young men to wage jihad in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, was arrested in London in May 2004, and is facing extradition to the United States on federal terrorism charges, brought by the same Manhattan federal prosecutors who have charged Aswat.
The details of the charges against Aswat, who is originally from Dewsbury in north-central England where one of the four July 7 bombers lived, were unclear.
Also unclear was the date when the charges were filed.
But one official said that they stemmed from his role in an effort by al-Masri to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Ore., in late 1999 and early 2000.
Aswat's role was detailed in a federal indictment filed in August 2002 in Seattle charging another man with providing material support to al-Qaida.
That man, Earnest James Ujaama, later pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of aiding the Taliban, and is cooperating with Manhattan federal prosecutors in the case against al-Masri.
Aswat is not named in the indictment against Ujaama, but is referred to in the document as unindicted coconspirator No.3, according to several law enforcement officials.
The indictment says he flew into to New York City on Nov. 26, 1999, on an Air India flight and traveled on to Bly, via Seattle to evaluate the property for its suitability to serve as a training camp.
Senior investigators have said that Aswat was believed to have met Osama bin Laden sometime in the late 1990s and that he trained at Qaida-run camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for the office of the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, David Kelley, which brought the charges against both al-Masri and Aswat, declined comment.
As the investigation intensified, Blair said that the police had already received some 5,000 calls to the anti-terrorism hotline, and had taken statements from 1,800 persons.
The police are also studying 15,000 closed circuit television tapes, he said.
It was not immediately clear how the nine men arrested Thursday were connected to the terror investigation.
Three of them were Turkish and worked in Kebab &amp; Hamburger Bar in London, said the shop's owner, Ahmet Ali.
Investigators believe that there is a link between the July 7 and July 21 attacks based on the similarity in the configuration of the bombs, but a British police official said that they were still not prepared to say conclusively that the attacks were linked.
Investigators are also uncertain if the July 7 attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, or whether the four men believed that the bombs would go off after they had left the train.
So far, no timing devices have been found, the official said Thursday, which would support the theory that the men were suicide bombers.
ITALY DOUBTS LONDON ATTACKS WERE PART OF BIGGER PLOT
The suspect arrested here in the failed London bombings of July 21 appears to have been part of an "impromptu" group without ties to any broader terrorist network in Italy, Italian anti-terror investigators said Monday.
"In the present state of the investigation, from his contacts with others, we can say that no links exist with a terrorist group active in Italy," Prefect Carlo De Stefano, a top official in the anti-terror police, told reporters here.
He added that it was "very probable," that the suspect, Hussain Osman, who also uses the name Hamdi Issac, did not have links with any organized terror group at all.
The suspect was tracked Friday to an apartment in Rome as the British police seized four others in London suspected of carrying out the attack July 21.
The British police said Monday night that police officers had raided three more locations in south London, arresting two men.
The police did not identify the men by name, but said they had been seized Monday in connection with the bombing attempts.
De Stefano did not play down the general risk of an attack here but said Osman did not appear to be in contact with any known terror groups.
Osman lived in Italy for five years, ending in 1996.
"We must say that the results we've had up to now support the hypothesis that they were just acquaintances, and that there is no involvement in any criminal activity," De Stefano said.
British investigators say they have not ruled out a connection between the bombings on July 7 and July 21, noting similarities in the crude, homemade bombs, and they have speculated on the possibility of a common mastermind.
The police have arrested 17 people in connection with the July 21 attacks, and British investigators say it is possible that a large logistical network helped the men responsible for the botched attacks in London.
Britain is now asking for Osman's return under a new extradition process in which the courts here have a maximum of 60 days to decide the case.
BRITAIN-TERROR-ART-1100&amp;ADD-NYT
ZAMBIA ARRESTS SUSPECTED QAIDA OPERATIVE SOUGHT BY U.S. Souad Mekhennet contributed reporting from Manchester, England, for this article.
LONDON -- Zambian authorities deported a suspected operative of al-Qaida to Britain on Sunday, and the police here said that the United States was seeking his extradition.
The man, Haroon Rashid Aswat, who is a British citizen, has been indicted in the United States on charges that he tried to set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Ore., in 1999.
The deportation coincided with a fresh wave of indictments against suspects in the attempted bombings in London on July 21.
Late on Sunday police announced that five people -- including two main suspects -- had been charged with crimes ranging from attempted murder to complicity in evading arrest in the attempted bombings of three subway trains and a bus that mimicked a far bloodier attack on July 7.
The newest indictments mean that the main suspects, with the exception of one man held in Rome, have now been charged with crimes arising from the events on July 21 that stunned London just two weeks after 56 people including four bombers died in the city's worst peacetime atrocity.
Yassin Hassan Omar, a 24-year-old Somali, was charged on Saturday with murder and other offenses.
The suspects had been detained under counterterrorism laws, which give the police a maximum 14 days to bring charges or release their suspects.
Two of the people indicted Sunday -- identified by the police as Ibrahim Muktar Said, 27, and Ramzi Mohamed, 23 -- were charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and unlawful possession of explosives.
Said, a naturalized Briton of Eritrean descent, is accused of trying to bomb a bus in east London, and Mohamed, about whom little had been made public, is said to have attacked a subway train near Oval station in south London.
Images of both men, taken from closed circuit television cameras, had been widely distributed in Scotland Yard's manhunt after the July 21 attacks.
But a charge list, distributed by the police, also included names not previously made public.
One of them, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, 32, was charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiring in the unlawful use of explosives.
One of the unsolved questions relating to the July 21 attacks had been whether explosives found abandoned in a park belonged to a so-called fifth bomber.
Asiedu's address was given as Finsbury Park in north London.
The two other men charged late Sunday were accused of helping other people evade arrest.
They were identified by the police as Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali, 30, and Wharbi Mohammed, 22, initially thought to be a brother of Ramzi Mohammed.
Britain is seeking the extradition of a further suspect, Hussain Osman, from Italy.
Osman, alao known as Hamdi Issac, has said through a court-appointed Italian lawyer that the July 21 attackers did not mean to kill anyone, but the British police say they were carrying explosives that could have spread carnage on the same scale as the July 7 bombings.
After the July 7 attack there had been initial reports of a link between the four attackers and Aswat, who was flown back to London from Zambia aboard an executive jet sent to Lusaka to collect him.
The jet carrying Aswat, 30, arrived at a Royal Air Force base in west London, where he was arrested and taken to a high-security police station in central London.
In a statement, the police said the United States wanted Aswat on charges that between Oct. 1, 1999, and April 30, 2000 -- long before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the subsequent war in Afghanistan -- he conspired to train people to fight a holy war in Afghanistan, presumably on the side of the Taliban, who were then its rulers.
The speed of the extradition hearings suggested that British investigators did not plan to interrogate Aswat about earlier reports linking him to the July bombers in London.
Peter Mumba, a senior official in the Zambian Interior Ministry, told reporters in Lusaka on Sunday that the British authorities had flown a plane to Zambia on Saturday to bring Aswat back to this country.
He is accused in the United States of working with Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Egyptian-born cleric embroiled in judicial hearings in Britain to determine whether it will approve his extradition to the United States.
Like Aswat, al-Masri is accused of involvement in the 1999 plot to establish a training camp in Oregon.
Aswat lived in Dewsbury, in northern England, in the same area as some of the four bombers who killed 52 people, along with themselves, in coordinated attacks on the London transportation system on July 7.
Two weeks later, at least four men staged what appeared to be an attempted copycat attack, but their explosives failed to detonate properly.
Aswat was detained in Zambia on July 20.
His deportation had initially been expected last Wednesday, but was delayed while he was being questioned about any ties he may have to terror networks in Pakistan, Zambian officials told Reuters.
The United States had reportedly sought Aswat's arrest earlier while he was in South Africa, but he slipped away through Botswana to Zambia.
In the investigation into the July 7 attacks in London, the police had reportedly initially sought to trace 20 phone calls made by Aswat to establish whether he was linked to the London bombings, but the police here have since played down the possibility of a connection.
The investigation has thrown up many theories, one of them of a link -- as reported in British newspapers on Sunday -- to two Moroccans suspected as Qaida members who were shot dead in Saudi Arabia earlier this year.
The men were identified in news reports as Abdulkarim el-Mejjati and Younis al-Hayyari.
"It is under investigation by both your security forces and our security forces," he said.
News agencies also quoted the Saudi foreign minister, Saud al-Faisal, as saying in Riyadh that British and Saudi intelligence officials routinely exchange information.
"I'm sure there is some information that may be linked to events in England," he said.
"They have also passed some information that was important to some of the incidents here."
The theories surfaced as Britain brought formal charges against Yasin Hassan Omar, a 24-year-old Somali who was arrested in Birmingham after the July 21 bombing attempts and who is accused of conspiracy to commit murder and possession of explosives.
Omar was the first of the main suspects to be charged formally.
He is to appear in court on Monday.

The measures could include closing some mosques, banning organizations and deporting some clerics.
She introduced herself to the audience of up to 2,000 mainly young people by saying the clothes she was wearing -- red and black scarves and a long dark blue dress -- were those she wore in captivity, not the orange coveralls given to detainees at the American facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
"It is time to stand up together.
Resistance is our duty.
"If you want to make war against Islam," she warned Blair, "I am ready."
However, others, like Sheik Shabir Ally, a cleric from Canada, expressed different views.
"And people are using sentences from the Quran out of context.
People have to be careful.
Taje Mustafa, a spokesman for Hizb ut-Tahrir, an organization Blair said he would ban, said: "Tony Blair wants to divide the Muslim community into two parts -- into extremists and moderates.
But who is extremist and who is moderate?
At a news conference on Friday, Blair warned that Islamic militants inciting hatred and violence could be deported or held under a form of house arrest known as control orders.
Several Muslims who offered fiery remarks to television interviewers last week are under investigation to determine whether they committed offenses, including treason, in making their statements.
One is Omar Bakri Mohammed, a Syrian-born cleric who led a group called Al Muhajiroun -- now said to have been disbanded -- whose successor organizations Blair also wishes to outlaw.
The debate over militant language extends beyond Muslims.
KATRINA-ADVISORY-NYT
Editors, The New York Times plans a package of stories on Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath for release Thursday, Sept. 1.
KATRINA-RDP (New Orleans) -- A ledeall as estimates of the death toll from the storm and flooding continue to rise.
New Orleans officials try to move out anyone remaining in the city, including a massive relocation of the 20,000 plus refugees at the Superdome, who will be relocated to the Astrodome in Houston.

An early lede, KATRINA, has moved.
KATRINA-FEDS (Washington) -- A ledeall from Washington.
The Bush administration began mounting a massive federal response on Wednesday to the devastating damage from Hurricane Katrina, deploying active duty military forces to the Gulf Coast to help with rescue and relief missions, authorizing the release of oil from the nation's strategic reserve to blunt the economic effects of the storm and dispatching growing quantities of food, water and medical supplies to the region.
President Bush returned to the White House from his vacation home in Texas to oversee the effort, getting a view of the damage en route as Air Force One altered its route to take him on a low-altitude pass over New Orleans and other stricken areas in Louisiana and Mississippi.
He will speak later in the Rose Garden.

BUSH-ASSESS (Washington) -- Not since he sat silently in a classroom in a Sarasota, Fla., elementary school as the World Trade Center burned and collapsed a thousand miles away has President Bush faced a test quite like the one he returned to Washington to confront on Wednesday afternoon.
But when the enemy is nature and the scene is spread over several states, the challenge is quite different.
And to complicate matters, Bush confronts this disaster at a time that his political capital is depleted, his poll ratings are at record lows and even some in the White House worry that Bush, on the last days of a month-long vacation, appeared out of position -- and perhaps too detached from the disaster unfolding along the Gulf Coast.

KATRINA-EVACUATE (New York) -- A rescue effort is under way to move the refugees from the Superdome to the Astrodome in Houston.
Officials hope to also move anyone else still remaining in the city.

From the Business Desk:
KATRINA-OIL (Undated) -- For the first time since the 1970s, gasoline lines reappeared in some corners of the country.
Three days after Hurricane Katrina dealt a devastating blow to the nation's largest energy hub, the worst-case scenario was quickly becoming a reality: Oil prices surging to stratospheric levels, services stations running out of gasoline, drivers waiting in line for dwindling supplies.
The storm, which submerged New Orleans as it slammed into the Gulf Coast, also impaired the country's energy industry from Houston to New England.
Around the region, in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama, power supplies were down, refineries went underwater, and nearly two dozens offshore platforms were submerged.
The impact is likely to be widely felt across the nation for months.

NEW-ORLEANS-MUSIC (Undated) -- A Critic's Notebook: New Orleans is a legendary center of American music.
It's thought of as a jazz hotspot -- the birthplace of both Dixieland and Wynton Marsalis -- and that's all it once was.
The contemporary New Orleans music scene is at least as important for hip-hop as it is for jazz.
What it mostly is is singular: a place where musicians play a gig in one club at 7:30, cross the street to play in another club at 9, then cross again to play a third club at 11.

And from the Style Desk's Home section:
KATRINA-WARD (Washington) -- Sitting safely in Washington, I am watching harrowing footage shot from helicopters above the Ninth Ward of New Orleans, submerged under 14 feet of water when the Mississippi thundered through the breached levee at the Industrial Canal, destroying everything in its swirling waters.
My home is there, a West Indian-style plantation house built in 1826, standing as an ancient relic amid a maze of wooden houses a century younger.
Some are classic bungalows, but most are distinctly New Orleans building types, with fanciful names like shotguns and camelbacks.
I watch as a neighbor is rescued from his rooftop, the water swirling only a few feet below him.
Dazed, he has just emerged from his attic, wriggling through a hole he hacked in the roof, to be swooped up on a swinging rope.
He is safe.
Scores of others aren't.
Tuesday night the mayor reported bodies floating through the streets of the Ninth Ward, bodies of the poor blacks and whites, creoles of color, and sprinkling of artists of every type who inhabit this deepest-dyed old New Orleans neighborhood.
By S. Frederick Starr.
KATRINA-ROOFS (Undated) -- On Tuesday night, Reed Kroloff, the dean of the architecture school at Tulane University in New Orleans, was holed up in a hotel in Houston watching footage of his city -- and possible his century-old Victorian house -- being walloped by Hurricane Katrina.
"The roof might be gone, or a giant oak tree has crashed through a window," Kroloff said in a phone interview.
Like many residents of New Orleans who fled, Kroloff was imagining the worst, and with good reason.
Although he had tried to secure his house by covering his windows and French doors with plywood, and closing shutters with bag ties, strong winds can wreak havoc with such measures in seconds.
Structural engineers say roofs are weak spots when it comes to high winds because when they hit a house an uplift is created that can tear away shingles and separate the roof from the rafters.
Winds also create horizontal pressure, called shear.
If a house isn't properly secured, the combination of uplift and shear can sometimes tip the house over.

HURRICANE KATRINA ("a" code) KATRINA-RDP (Undated) -- A ledeall.
A week after the storm, a definitive death toll remained elusive, but New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin warned on NBC's "Today" that "it wouldn't be unreasonable to have 10,000" dead.
Residents of one hard hit area of New Orleans, Jefferson Parish, were allowed to re-enter the area to assess what if anything is left of their former lives.
President Bush began his second trip to the region since the storm hit, landing in Baton Rouge late in the morning to start another inspection tour and consultations with federal and local officials.
At two of the city's damaged levees, engineers continued making repairs that would allow pumps to begin draining the floodwaters, and officials said that fewer than 10,000 people remained in the city, based on aerial reconnaissance.

SUPREME COURT ("w" code) SCOTUS-APPOINT (Washington) -- A ledeall: President Bush nominated Judge John G.Roberts Jr.on Monday to replace Chief Justice William H.Rehnquist, whose death late Saturday opened a second vacancy on the Supreme Court and a new front in the ideological battle over the judiciary.
Senate leaders agreed Monday morning to delay by at least two days the start of Roberts's confirmation hearing, which had been set to begin on Tuesday, when he was being considered to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
Now that Bush has nominated him for the chief justice's job, several Senate and Congressional leaders had asked that the hearings be delayed until after Rehnquist's funeral, which is Wednesday.

IRAQ, NOT KATRINA, MAY BE ACHILLES HEEL FOR BUSH
WASHINGTON - Many Democrats regard Hurricane Katrina as a political earthquake, an event destined to shake the Bush administration to its core, weakening the president's ability to promote his domestic agenda, and perhaps even prompting a reassessment of President Bush's character and abilities.
But the first round of public-opinion polls detected a political tremor, not an earthquake.
Indeed, some polls show that the hurricane has been a distraction from the longer-term issues plaguing Bush - principally the war in Iraq.
In other words, Bush may be weakened, and his agenda may be in trouble, but it's not just because of his handling of the hurricane.
And Democrats, who are already rushing to use the hurricane to promote their own priorities - from defeating the Supreme Court nominee, John G. Roberts Jr., to modifying the tough new bankruptcy law -might do just as well to focus on other issues.
An AP-Ipsos poll conducted from Sept. 6 to Sept. 8, more than a week after the hurricane, found that Bush's approval ratings had dropped to a weak 39 percent, from 42 percent in August.
But the percentage of Americans approving of Bush's performance on the hurricane - 46 percent - was much higher than the 37 percent approving of his handling of Iraq.
More people approved of Bush's efforts on the hurricane than of his work on the economy, health care, foreign policy, Social Security, or gas prices.
A Gallup poll conducted last week for CNN and USA Today was consistent with the AP-Ipsos findings.
It found that almost twice as many Americans (25 percent) had blamed state and local officials for problems with hurricane relief than had blamed Bush (13 percent).
The largest percentage, 38 percent, held no one responsible for the relief crisis.
However, a Pew Research Center poll asked the question in different terms last week, and found that a whopping 67 percent thought Bush could have done more to help the hurricane victims, even though some state and local officials shared the blame.
The key for Bush, said Pew Research Center director Andrew Kohut, will be whether perceptions of an inadequate response to the hurricane alter the way people view Bush - less firm in a crisis.
"Not all of Bush's problems reside with Katrina, but he's been roundly criticized for the way he's handled the hurricane," said Kohut.
Bush is working hard to counter the perception that he hasn't paid enough attention to hurricane relief by making his third trip to New Orleans in two weeks.
His supporters hope the availability of other scapegoats - including the Democratic governor of Louisiana, Kathleen Blanco, and the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, C.Ray Nagin - take some focus off the president.
They also hope that people will be judicious in apportioning blame for what was, at bottom, a natural disaster.
By contrast, Bush's responsibility for the Iraq war has long been acknowledged and accepted by the president himself.
And the percentage of Americans who support the war has been dropping steadily all year, as has the percentage believing that the war has made the United States safer.
"It's his war.
It's not going well.
It has his name on it."
After months of trying to agree on common goals, the Democrats in the House and Senate seem to have resigned themselves to criticizing Bush's policies - while saying little about their alternatives.
It seems likely that Katrina will continue to alter priorities in ways that could be beneficial to Democrats.
The Pew poll, for instance, found that for the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a majority believes that the president should concentrate on domestic issues, not foreign policy.
But the public doesn't need Democrats to tell them what went wrong with Bush's response to the disaster in New Orleans.
The public needs Democrats to offer fresh alternatives on the economy and security.
The public, at least according to polls, is ready and eager to think about new ideas.
The Democrats may not be.

BUSH ADMITS KATRINA MISTAKES
President Bush made a rare admission of error Tuesday as he accepted responsibility for the weak federal response to Hurricane Katrina and vowed to get to the bottom of what went wrong.
Bush, who belatedly cut short his summer vacation and returned to Washington after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast two weeks ago, planned to address the nation Thursday evening from New Orleans during his fourth visit to the stricken region.
Bush spoke in response to a reporter asking whether Americans, in light of the federal government's sluggish response to Katrina, should be concerned about whether Washington is prepared to handle another disaster or even a terrorist attack.
"I want to know what went right and what went wrong," Bush said.
"I want to know how to better cooperate with state and local government -- to be able to answer that very question that you asked:
Are we capable of dealing with a severe attack or another severe storm?
And it's in our national interest that we find out what went on so that we can better respond."
Even as he acknowledged problems, Bush praised Coast Guard and other rescue teams in the devastated area.
While still considerably lower than earlier estimates by local officials, Katrina's death toll, mainly from massive flooding after the hurricane passed, reached 423 in Louisiana on Tuesday, and 236 in Mississippi and elsewhere along the Gulf Coast.
During a tour of hurricane-stricken Mississippi, U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta said Katrina has caused the worst transportation disaster in American history, hamstringing movement of people and cargo in ports, on highways and along rivers.
"Accountability at every level is critical, and leadership begins at the top."
A Senate committee, headed by Republican Sen.Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen.Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, was scheduled today (Wednesday) to hold the first of what will likely be many congressional hearings on the Katrina response.
R.David Paulison, newly named head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Bush told him during a phone conversation Monday evening that he "would have all the support of the federal government" to help Katrina survivors rebuild their lives and to aid in the ravaged area's reconstruction.
"I can't deal with what happened in the last two weeks, but I can tell you, from this point forward, we are going to be focused on the victims of this hurricane," Paulison told reporters.
"We've had a hurricane of unimaginable proportions, and we're going to deal with it.
We're going to get the people out of shelters, and we're going to move on and get them the help that they need."
"We're going to focus on the victims out there of this hurricane from this point forward, and there'll be a time and place to sit down and look at those lessons learned," he said.
"Now is the time to move forward, make sure they get the help they need and help they deserve."
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff chose Paulison to replace Michael Brown, who resigned Monday after days of cascading criticism of FEMA's response to Katrina.
Chertoff had already recalled Brown to Washington and removed him from heading on-the-ground rescue and relief efforts in the Gulf Coast region.
Paulison has 30 years' experience in disaster rescue operations.
Among his previous jobs, he headed the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department and ran Dade County's emergency-management office, helping lead Florida's response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
The state named him fire chief of the year in 1993.
Landrieu joined Sen.David Vitter, a freshman Republican from Louisiana, on the Senate floor Tuesday in announcing plans by the state's congressional delegation to introduce a bill later this week to set up an independent reconstruction commission.
Sen.Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, proposed last week that Congress create the Gulf Coast Redevelopment Authority.
It would be modeled after the Tennessee Valley Authority, which President Franklin Roosevelt and Congress established during the Depression to revitalize the seven-state Tennessee Valley region.
"This has to be a partnership, because ultimately the communities are entitled to take responsibility and empower themselves."
Chertoff said he was sending teams of inspectors from his giant agency's inspector general's office to the area to oversee spending and contract awards from the nearly $62 billion in emergency aid authorized by Congress, a total expected to rise to as high as $200 billion.
"The message that has gone out very clearly to everybody (is) that we're going to be efficient, we're going to cut through red tape, but we're not going to cut through the laws and the rules that govern ethics," Chertoff said.
Saying that "we are still in hurricane season," Chertoff also warned that the country could face new storms even as it tries to recover from Katrina.
"They collected food, water, ice, generators, fuel and other necessities, and with no plan and with no budget, they got it to devastated areas -- in many cases over a week ahead of the bureaucrats," Vitter said.
GOVERNMENT TO INVESTIGATE KATRINA RELIEF EFFORT
The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday his office has received allegations of fraud and waste in the multibillion-dollar relief programs linked to Hurricane Katrina and would investigate how no-bid contracts were awarded to several large, politically well-connected companies.
The inspector general, Richard L. Skinner, who serves as the department's internal watchdog, said in an interview that he intended to be "extremely aggressive" in monitoring the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will receive most of the $62 billion in disaster-response funds approved by Congress last week.
FEMA, which is part of Homeland Security, was harshly criticized in recent months for mismanaging millions of dollars in relief funds for Hurricane Frances last year.
Skinner's remarks came as the secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff; Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales; and Republican congressional leaders said Tuesday that they also were concerned about the potential for abuse, given the amount of federal money and private charity committed to the hurricane-relief effort.
"We haven't suspended the laws that govern the way in which people have to behave ethically and legally."
Spokesmen at FEMA have been unwilling to provide details of the decision-making process that is being used to award contracts for the hurricane-relief program, nor have they identified the agency officials who are making the procurement decisions.
During the Bush administration, the agency's senior management has included several officials without significant experience in disaster relief, including its former director, Michael Brown, who resigned on Monday.
Skinner, a former acting inspector general of FEMA, would not discuss details of the allegations his office has received in recent days involving Katrina relief projects.
But he said he was dispatching about 30 investigators and auditors to Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama next week to "focus on prevention -- to prevent things from going wrong" in the way the disaster money is spent.
He said that his investigators would focus on several no-bid contracts awarded during the last two weeks to large, politically influential companies, including the Fluor Corp. of California, a major donor to the Republican Party, and the Shaw Group, based in Baton Rouge, La.
Shaw is a client of Joe M.Allbaugh, a consultant who is the former head of FEMA and was President Bush's campaign manager in 2000.
Another of Allbaugh's clients -- Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, the giant defense contractor once led by Vice President Dick Cheney -- is doing major repairs at Navy facilities along the Gulf Coast that were damaged by the hurricane.
That work is being done under a $500 million contract with the Defense Department.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
He said his investigators would also closely monitor expenditures on the government-issued credit cards of Department of Homeland Security contracting officials involved in the hurricane-relief program.
Skinner said his office had acquired computer software that would allow his investigators to monitor the credit-card charges on a daily basis.
He added, "If we see a credit card purchase of $250,000, we would immediately find out whether it was appropriate."
In recognition of potential problems, the Office of Management and Budget announced Tuesday it was issuing new rules on use of the credit cards, requiring supervisors to identify which procurement officials could make use of the $250,000 limit and to set clear policies on which items could be purchased for the relief effort.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Under the $51.8 billion hurricane-relief bill approved by Congress last week, Skinner's office was provided with $15 million for investigations related to Hurricane Katrina.
Skinner's office produced a harshly critical audit earlier this year of FEMA's performance after Hurricane Frances struck Florida during the Labor Day weekend of 2004.
The audit questioned millions of dollars in federal payouts to residents of Miami-Dade County even though the county suffered little damage.
The audit found that more than $8 million was given to 4,300 people for temporary housing even though they had not asked for the money and most never left their homes.
The disaster agency paid out more than $720,000 to county residents to replace belongings that they claimed were damaged or destroyed, based on their word alone.
U.S. Rep.Robert Wexler, D-Fla., called at the time of the audit for Brown to resign as FEMA director.
EDITORIAL: FEMA NEEDS NEW LEADER, BUT ISSUE IS BIGGER THAN THAT
Michael Brown resigned Monday as director of an agency he appeared unqualified to lead, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Someone with emergency services -- and hurricane -- experience now is filling the top FEMA post.
Brown was right in his departing statement that the focus should not be on him, but on FEMA.
And whatever happens at FEMA is of grave importance to southern Beaufort County.
Sooner or later, it will be our turn to look to FEMA as a lifeline, not a politically-charged news story.
Perhaps the president will speak to that issue in his planned -- and overdue -- address to the nation from Louisiana on Thursday.
Yes, a focus should be on FEMA. But remember, FEMA is the whipping boy every time a hurricane strikes.
We remember it from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered the Lowcountry in 1989.
And that was a storm not nearly as severe as Katrina.
Still, FEMA could not do enough to suit the understandably impatient and disgruntled hurricane victims.
Katrina seems to be telling the nation that there are disasters too big for FEMA, even under the best of leadership.
It is telling us there are disasters too big for governors and stricken county and municipal governments.
All of these governments play a vital role, of course.
And Katrina is showing how bad things can get when any link in the government chain is frail.
But it is time for this nation to recognize that it must sometimes -- and in a timely manner -- call on the organizations that truly are prepared, staffed, equipped and trained to handle such a large disaster.
That is the U.S. military.
The USS Bataan happened to be in the Gulf of Mexico and followed the hurricane to shore.
It was, as it turns out, a "first responder.
" But it was not used to the fullest.
It offered medical and rescue capabilities.
It could produce 100,000 gallons of fresh water per day.
It has smaller vessels able to go ashore with supplies and doctors.
But that capability was not tapped fully when it was needed.
The nation instead saw mayhem at the New Orleans Superdome and convention center.
The Katrina problem has a solution.
America responded well to the tsunami, and it can respond well to a three-state, Category 4 hurricane.
Unfortunately, the nation is tripping over its own feet.

BIRD FLU COULD KILL THOUSANDS IN WEEKS
If the dire predictions of an influenza pandemic come true, Minnesota's health officials expect 1.25 million state residents to become infected.
In a matter of days, a surge of patients would overwhelm the hospital system.
State government officials and hospitals, using emergency powers, would sort patients through triage, even moving them among regions of the state.
Still, each hospital bed in the state would have as many as five patients waiting to fill it, according to Minnesota emergency preparedness officials.
An estimated 20,000 people would die.
And it would all happen in four to eight weeks.
In Minnesota, as in other states, the preparation for a deadly influenza outbreak has been underway for many years, but planning went into high gear in 2001 after fears of an anthrax or other bioterrorism disaster.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which had been criticized for dragging its feet on an avian flu response plan, could release a proposal next week, according to news reports.
Experts' concerns
They know that it spreads quickly among birds, and that it's deadly -- it's killed millions of chickens and other fowl throughout Asia since it first surfaced in Hong Kong in 1997.
In humans, the death toll is in the dozens.
So far, almost all the human victims had close contact with diseased animals, which means that it's not spreading from person to person.
But that could change.
In the worst-case scenario, the avian flu virus would come into contact with a flu strain that does pass easily from person to person.
That could happen if an individual becomes infected with both strains at the same time.
In that setting, it could morph into a new virus with the worst of all traits: deadly, fast, and transmissible by a sneeze or a handshake.
If that happens, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated last year, as many as 100 million people could die.
Last week, a United Nations official upped it to 150 million.
Dr. Harry Hull, Minnesota's top public health official, said the avian flu virus presents a credible threat.
But he cautioned that the avian virus is not guaranteed to mutate into a dangerous human influenza virus.
It could just die out in birds, he said, or mutate into a form to which the human system learns how to adapt.
If that were the case, it would be more like SARS, which is relatively difficult to spread from person to person.
The once-feared SARS is now controlled by isolating infected patients.
The preparations for a global influenza epidemic are similar to the planning that must be done for most public health crises.
"There's a lot of work being done," Hull said.
"It is the same kind of questions involved with bioterrorism.
"The question is, how do we take what we have available to make sure that the maximum number of people survive?" he said.
Minnesota's hospitals have signed regional compacts binding them to share resources and coordinate responses in the event of a major emergency.
There are 29 hospitals in the metropolitan pact.
All are linked through an emergency radio system and an Internet crisis communications network.
"We used it here during the Katrina event to coordinate among the metropolitan hospitals and other regions in the state, putting together volunteers," said Mark Lappe, director of safety, security and emergency preparedness at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis.
The hospitals would share equipment and staff, and admissions would be coordinated among all the hospitals.
"If we exceed the capacity in the hospitals themselves, then we might set up an offsite hospital, an austere hospital site, to provide basic health care," said Lappe.
The austere -- or bare-bones -- hospital could be located in a school, auditorium or convention center, he said.
Fears about a catastrophic flu outbreak have waxed and waned in the medical world for years.
The same fears were cited in 1976 during the swine flu scare, when millions of Americans were inoculated against a terror that never materialized.
The big fear is that the world may face a repeat of the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed anywhere from 20 million to 50 million people in less than a year, including about 675,000 Americans.
That virus spread swiftly and easily and had a fearsome death rate -- about 5 percent.
Historians say that some victims woke up feeling well, got sick by noon and were dead by nightfall.
It was even too big for the word "epidemic.
" Experts called it a pandemic -- a worldwide epidemic.
Two less-deadly flu pandemics struck in the 20th century -- the Asian flu in 1957-58 and the Hong Kong flu in 1968-69.
EDITORIAL:BIRD FLU AND THE 1918 PANDEMIC
The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Oct. 8:
The worrisome news is that the 1918 virus appears to have jumped directly from birds to humans, and that the genetic changes that allowed it to do so are already beginning to appear in the avian strain, known as H5N1, which has killed large numbers of birds and about 60 people in four Asian countries.
The two most recent pandemics, in 1957 and 1968, were caused by human flu viruses that picked up some bird flu components.
Now it turns out that the far more lethal 1918 virus, which killed perhaps 20 million to 100 million people, was most likely an avian strain that jumped directly into humans.
That gives today's avian strain two routes to wreak havoc among humans.
It could either mix some of its genes with human influenza, like the 1957 and 1968 viruses, or it could mutate on its own to become easily transmissible among humans, like the 1918 virus.
So far, the avian virus has rarely jumped from birds to humans and seldom spread from one human to another.
But it may be traveling slowly down the same evolutionary path as the 1918 virus.
Two top federal health officials said that the H5N1 virus has already acquired five of the 10 genetic sequence changes associated with human-to-human transmission of the 1918 virus.
That does not necessarily mean that catastrophe is imminent.
Nobody knows how likely it is that further mutations will occur or how long the process may take.
The avian virus has been around for decades without turning into a monster.
The new findings offer promising leads to health officials who are concerned about preparing for a possible pandemic.
Scientists should be able to prepare a checklist of the most worrisome genetic changes so they can monitor the evolution of the avian flu virus and rush medical help to any area where it looks as if the virus is becoming more transmissible.
They may also be able to develop drugs and vaccines aimed at the most important genetic targets, thus allowing them to treat or even prevent influenza more effectively.
Nobody knows whether the avian strain now under the spotlight will become a bigger threat to humans.
But some day a potential pandemic strain will arrive.
The new findings could help develop tools to contain it.
THE FRONT LINES IN THE BATTLE AGAINST AVIAN FLU ARE RUNNING SHORT OF MONEY
As the Bush administration and Congress prepare to spend billions of dollars to improve America's ability to combat avian flu, crucial needs are being left unmet on the front lines of the world's defenses against the disease, in some cases for lack of a few million dollars, international health officials said Saturday.
When Vietnam began detecting the disease in chickens nearly two years ago, it initially slaughtered and burned every chicken within three miles of an infected fowl in an effort to prevent the spread of the disease.
Yielding to popular pressure, the government has steadily shrunk the culling radius.
Officials now kill only those birds in an infected household flock that do not die of the disease by themselves.
Birds from different households, even those only a few yards away and also at risk from the disease, are left untouched, Vietnamese officials said.
In Indonesia, a lack of money to compensate farmers for culled chickens prompted the government to announce last year a less expensive policy of vaccinating chickens.
One risk of such a strategy is that the virus will adapt and infect even unvaccinated chickens without causing symptoms of illness.
That makes it extremely difficult to keep live, infected chickens from being sold in markets.
Indonesian and Hong Kong health officials said this week that exactly this problem of chickens infected but without symptoms had been detected in Indonesia.
But the World Health Organization cautioned that more lab tests were needed, which takes time because of a shortage of staff and equipment.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has been trying since February to raise $100 million from donor nations to pay for veterinary services and diagnostic equipment to assess and slow the spread of avian flu in chickens and other fowl.
The FAO decided at the time not to ask for more money, to compensate farmers for the culling of their flocks, after concluding that donors would not be willing to contribute any more.
But so far, the organization has raised barely $30 million, leaving many veterinary needs unmet.
The $100 million figure "is what we think is the minimum for what the countries in the region need immediately to contain the virus" and slow its spread, said Diderik De Vleeschauwer, the FAO's spokesman in Bangkok.
Eradication of the disease in birds is already impossible, he added, because it has become so widespread in Southeast Asia.
But containing the spread of the disease could reduce the opportunities for the virus to acquire the ability to pass easily from person to person, a requisite for the virus to cause a global pandemic.
More preparations have been made in Asia to respond to human cases of avian influenza, as opposed to cases of the disease in birds, especially in the past year.
Vietnam has a comprehensive plan that covers how government agencies responsible for everything from finance to tourism would respond to an epidemic.
Japan has begun manufacturing its own Tamiflu, a costly antiviral medicine that until recently was made only in Europe.
Hong Kong is assembling a database of private doctors willing to do volunteer work in government hospitals in the event of an epidemic.
South Korea is one of several governments in the region that has run an elaborate simulation for how government agencies might respond to a wide outbreak of the disease.
"They had this huge operations room, video links and they had clips of news broadcasts by actual broadcasters."
Many of the gaps lie in differences in incomes among Asian countries.
Very poor countries like Cambodia and Laos still struggle to provide even the most basic health care to people outside their biggest cities.
Health officials worry that if the bird flu virus, A(H5N1) avian influenza, were to start spreading in either country, it could become entrenched and out of control before the international health community even became aware of it, quickly spreading across borders and around the globe.
Teams of experts from the WHO, the FAO and other U.N. agencies are scheduled to visit both countries later this year to assess their needs in fighting a possible pandemic and to provide advice.

China's preparedness for fighting avian flu is something of a mystery.
Beijing authorities have announced that they have a draft plan to deal with a pandemic, but have divulged few details.
China's Agriculture Ministry has said that it is conducting extensive tests to identify sick animals and has found very few, but the availability of veterinary and medical care varies greatly from province to province and even within provinces.
Asia's most affluent societies have taken the greatest precautions.
Hong Kong, for example, has a health system that by some measures, like infant mortality rates and longevity of citizens, is better than the American system.
In Hong Kong, more than 100 private and state-run clinics, and most of the territory's nursing homes and child care centers, now provide the government with detailed, weekly reports on the number of fever cases and other illnesses, said Dr.Ronald Lam, the principal medical officer for emergency preparedness at the Hong Kong Health Department.
Some of the most elaborate preparations are under way in Taiwan, which has diplomatic relations with only 26 small nations, mostly in Africa, the South Pacific and the Caribbean, and worries that it might be cut off in a pandemic.
Taiwan was not only one of the earliest buyers of a national Tamiflu stockpile two years ago, but also set up its own small vaccine factory this summer.
The factory will manufacture 200,000 doses of an experimental vaccine created by Taiwanese scientists against the avian flu virus from genetically altered strains supplied by British and American laboratories, said Dr.Kou Hsu-sung, the director general of Taiwan's Center for Disease Control.
The doses will not be used even in safety or clinical trials.
They will be kept ready for a possible pandemic in which almost any vaccine, however untested, may be used.
So far, the virus has killed more than half of those infected.
"If we cannot get the ones produced by the pharmaceutical companies, we will use ours in an emergency," Kou said.
And he said the Department of Health and Human Services has delayed completion of a national plan on how to respond to the pandemic.
HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt was in Vietnam on Friday as part of an Asian tour to discuss avian flu with international health officials and representatives of countries where a handful of human cases of H5N1 influenza have occurred.
His press representatives did not respond to Waxman's charges.
Health experts in and out of government have warned repeatedly in recent months of a possible pandemic of a new influenza strain for which there is little human resistance.
Confirmation this week that the H5N1 strain of avian influenza was found in poultry in Turkey heightened fears that this form of the disease may be about to mutate into a strain that can spread among humans.

U.N. HEALTH OFFICIALS FEAR AFRICA IS ALSO AT RISK FOR BIRD FLU
As bird flu has jumped this year from Southeast Asia to China, Russia, Kazakhstan and -- more recently -- into the Balkan region of Europe, scientists have become somewhat belatedly convinced that wild migratory birds are one of the main carriers of the dreaded H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
Although there is widespread anxiety about the arrival of bird flu in Europe -- European Union health ministers will convene a special session on Thursday to discuss the problem -- the next stops on bird migratory pathways are not in Western Europe, but in the Middle East, North Africa and East Africa itself, United Nations, officials here say.
Countries and farmers in these parts of the world, particularly in East Africa, are completely unprepared, lacking both the money and scientific infrastructure to control outbreaks of the virus, the U.N. officials said.
If the disease touches down there, it could well become widespread in the environment and on farms before it is even detected, he said.
Also, because in poorer African nations people live in close proximity with animals, such a situation would provide a dangerous crucible for the mixing or the bird and human viruses, vastly increasing the risk that the avian virus could gain the ability to readily spread among humans.
"The close proximity between people and animals and insufficient surveillance and disease control capability in eastern African countries create an ideal breeding ground for the virus," Domenech said.
While H5N1 bird flu does not readily infect humans or spread between them, scientists fear that it could acquire that ability through biological mixing processes by which viruses can exchange genes if they are close together.
If the H5N1 strain were capable of spreading from man to man, they say, it could be the source of a devastating human flu pandemic.
In developed nations, bird flu outbreaks are controlled by aggressive public health measures.
Once the virus is suspected -- usually signaled by unusual bird deaths -- it is then stamped out by a combination of preventive culls and quarantines, even before the actual presence of the virus is confirmed.
Confirmation of H5N1 often takes a few days, since bird specimens must be sent to a specialized reference lab for typing.
In Macedonia, for example, health authorities were killing 10,000 birds in a small southern village Wednesday as they waited for tests to be performed in England, to confirm that the H5N1 strain was involved.
Another possible outbreak was reported in the Tula region in Russian, just west of the Urals.
In response to the first large-scale bird flu outbreak, in Hong Kong in late 1997, one million birds were killed in a day to stop the disease.
But such a procedure, which is extremely effective at controlling bird flu, would be difficult to perform in Africa, U.N. officials said.
Farmers have to report suspicious deaths quickly to the health authorities, who need to be poised for immediate investigation and killing.
Mandatory culls are problematic in poor countries, where a family's chickens are often not just a commercial product, but also a crucial source of family food.
The deadly strain of avian influenza is widespread in Southeast Asia.
But compliance with culls has sometimes been difficult in poorer parts of the region.
Poor farmers may choose not to report deaths for fear of loosing their bird.
Worse still, they may simply slaughter sick birds before health authorities confiscate them, in order to eat the birds or to sell them at local markets.
Eating meat from birds infected with the virus is not dangerous, since it is not a food-borne illness and dies with cooking.
But touching the birds may infect humans, who can get bird flu with close contact.
More worrisome, transport of sick bird or their carcasses to markets may infect other birds, spreading the animal pandemic, and making a human one ever more likely.
The virus persists for at least a short while on feathers and eggshells.
The United Nations will help countries in Africa strengthen surveillance, Domenech said.
But the international community will also have to help poor countries compensate farmers for their losses when their animals are killed, so that they will be willing to report and comply.
Domenech stressed that the bird flu risk due to wild bird is still relatively low.
But if the disease is established in Africa, it is likely to come to Europe next spring as the bird return north for the summer.
Although there is widespread anxiety about the arrival of bird flu in Europe -- EU Health Ministers will convene a special session on Thursday to discuss the problem -- the next stops on bird migratory pathways are not in western Europe, but in the Middle East, North Africa and East Africa, U.N. officials here say.

'NAIVE' IMMUNE SYSTEMS MAKE AVIAN FLU A MAJOR THREAT
Cox News Service
? WASHINGTON - The fear that the A/H5N1 avian flu could kill millions of people is based on the simple fact that very few people have ever had an influenza virus like this one - a situation immunologists call "naivete."
?Mostly, avian flu does the same things to the body as its cousin, the flu that causes annual epidemics in the United States and other countries - it just does them worse.
But human immune systems can fight back against the annual flu because they have leftover antibodies and killer cells from previous bouts of illness or vaccinations.
These disease fighters are less than perfect, because each year's flu is slightly different, but they fight a sort of holding action while the body produces new antibodies and killer cells specifically tailored to the current strain.
In the case of avian flu, the immune system is faced with a disease unlike anything it has ever encountered and is unable to react quickly enough to fight off the swarming virus.
? "With a flu you've never seen before you're at much higher risk of having severe disease, because you don't recognize it at all," said Andrew MacGinnitie, an immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
? "It takes a couple of weeks to generate your own antibody response to the new virus.
Unfortunately, it can kill you in that time," he added.
? When it infects chickens and other birds, influenza virus concentrates in the digestive track, but in humans it concentrates on cells in the airways and lungs.
? A cell inside the lungs is doomed as soon as the virus invades it.
The cell is forced to produce more virus, then it basically bursts, releasing vast numbers of new virus particles to invade other cells.
? Without effective immune system opposition, dead cells accumulate in the lungs.
At the same time, injured lung tissue starts to leak fluids.
? "So far in the cases of people who have caught H5N1 from birds," MacGinnitie said, "at some point your lungs stop working and you die."
? There is one major difference between pandemic flu and seasonal influenza, and it may explain why the 1918 "Great Influenza" pandemic took a disproportionate number of lives among young and seemingly healthy individuals.
? The 1918 pandemic, caused by a virus that has been designated H1N1, was the last time the world has faced a completely new form of influenza, health experts say.
? Seasonal flu epidemics - and pandemics that occurred in 1957 and 1967 - have been most severe among very young children and elderly people.
? But about half of the 1918 victims were between 18 and 44, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
? He thinks the reason for this was a deadly immune system paradox that could happen again.
It is called "cytokine storm."
? Confronted with a strange new virus against which it has no effective antibodies, the immune system goes into a kind of biochemical panic and floods the lungs with other disease-fighting substances.
Before the virus has destroyed enough cells to interfere with the lungs' function, the patient suffocates on his own immune system chemistry.
?"The immune system sees this virus that it has never seen before, and it just goes bananas," said Laurie Garrett, a health writer and fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
(Story can end here.
Optional add follows.)
?Although MacGinnitie said he also worries about cytokine storm, he disputes reports that more than half of the people who have contracted "bird flu" in Asia have died.
? Last week, the World Health Organization reported that of 118 confirmed cases in which the virus had "jumped" from birds to humans, 61 victims had died.
?"If you're in Asia and you work on a poultry farm, you probably would have to be near death before you would go to a hospital," he said.
? If one-third of all Americans became ill in a pandemic, that would be about 100 million cases.
If one in 200 died, that would be 500,000 deaths.
? Annual flu epidemics typically kill 35,000 Americans.

AVIAN FLU THREAT COULD WIDEN A graphic is being sent to NYTNS Photo Service subscribers.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or 888-603-1036.
) Could a germ-laden, sneeze-ridden pig do us in?
It wouldn't be the first time: There are plenty of examples of viruses making the lethal leap from animals to humans.
AIDS from monkeys.
SARS from bats.
Bubonic plague from flea-infested rats.
And, maybe, swine will prove crucial to the transmission of an influenza virus capable of killing millions of people across the world.
For that to happen, there must be a collision of forces, both ancient and modern.
Right now, there is a strain of flu stalking birds in swaths of Asia and Eastern Europe.
There's nothing new about birds catching the flu; there are 144 basic types of avian flu.
"These have existed since there have been birds," said Dr.Mark Pokras, a wildlife veterinarian at Tufts University's Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine.
"If I went out to anywhere in New England and captured 100 ducks and tested them for avian influenza, about 30 to 40 would have avian influenza."
But the strain infecting those ducks would likely be pretty benign.
In poultry, for example, the weak form of flu doesn't do much more than ruffle some feathers and reduce egg production for a time.
The bird flu everybody's talking about now is vastly different.
It was first detected in 1997 and can kill an entire flock in 48 hours.
Scientists, as they do with all flu strains, tagged it with a code name based on proteins in the germ: H5N1, they called it.
"And in the chickens, it has been expanding relentlessly since 1997," said Dr.Ruben Donis, an influenza specialist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It was in 2003 that the virulent strain of bird flu became a major concern.
The virus that year rampaged through poultry in Southeast Asia.
Never, said the World Health Organization, had avian flu caused so much devastation with so much speed.
The flu that was making all those birds so sick is distinct from the strains that strike people.
There's a good reason for that: A virus is like a key in search of a lock - a lock that will allow it to gain entry into cells so that it can replicate.
Different animals have different cellular locks, which scientists call receptors.
Chickens have one kind, humans another.
So flu viruses need to have the right kind of key to get into the right kind of animal.
"Bird viruses are adapted to grow well in birds," said Dr.John Treanor, a University of Rochester infectious disease specialist.
"And that's normally where they like to stay."
That's true - unless humans have prolonged, direct exposure to infected birds, which somehow allows a virus that's mostly a peril to birds to also become a threat to people.
In December 2003, human cases of avian influenza began appearing in Asia.
Disease investigators discovered that, in some cases, the victims worked in slaughterhouses.
And then there was the man in Vietnam who fancied drinking duck blood - blood that wound up carrying avian flu virus.
"But it did."
In the past two years, 118 people in four Asian nations have been diagnosed with avian flu, resulting in 61 deaths.
There's little evidence that one person has spread it to another, little evidence that, at the moment, it poses a widespread human threat.
That could be the end of the story.
But when it comes to disease outbreaks, there's rarely such a tidy coda.
In part, that's because viruses loath stability.
Survival depends both on the ability to spread to new hosts and the drive to change.
"Viruses are constantly mutating," the CDC's Donis said, "trying to make sure one virus out there will do what is necessary to survive."
The avian flu strain, researchers said, has already begun to change its genetic clothing in significant, and dangerous, ways, affecting how easily it infects cells and spreads.
In the northern part of Vietnam, there's a different strain than in the south.
And the virus is colonizing new victims.
A few months back, it became clear that avian flu had spread from poultry to migratory birds.
Within the past few weeks, those traveling birds have turned up on Western Europe's doorstep, bearing the virus.
The pace of infections in humans is increasing, too.
The avian flu has already displayed two of three key traits necessary for a global epidemic known as a pandemic: It's a virus that most humans have never been exposed to, so they have no immune system protection against it.
And it's a virus with the capacity, in certain select cases, to infect people.
"The only one condition that has not been met to set a pandemic in motion is that the virus needs to be very efficient and easily transmitted human-to-human," said Dr.Mark Gendreau, a travel medicine specialist at the Lahey Clinic.
There are two ways the virus could do that.
It could, on its own, change genetic clothing just enough to be able to move into human cells with ease and spread from person to person.
The second path to a pandemic involves combining the avian flu and the common human form in the same victim, where the two strains could exchange genetic material.
That might happen in a human.
But, even more likely, the two flu strains could infect swine.
Pigs, it turns out, have cellular receptors for both bird flu and human flu, meaning they can catch both at once.
And as modern food production has resulted in massive commercial livestock farms in Asia, big flocks of chicken often sit next to equally big pens of pigs.
Unlike in the United States, where most poultry is raised in shelters, Asian farms more often keep chickens and pigs in the open, exposing them to migratory birds infected with the flu.
The swine could pick up flu germs from the chickens - and flu germs from the humans who care for them.
Inside the pig, the two strains could swap bits of genetic code until a new and highly lethal virus is born.
There is, specialists said, no guarantee that either pandemic scenario will happen.
The virus could fade away, as SARS did two years ago.
And even if bird flu is destined to be the first global flu epidemic of this century, there's no certainty when that will happen.
"The reality," Donis said, "is we don't know if we are five inches from the edge of the cliff or two miles from the edge of the cliff."

BUSH-FLU-NYT
REPORT: OUTBREAK OF AVIAN FLU COULD INFECT ONE-THIRD OF U.S. POPULATION Gardiner Harris reported from Washington for this article and Timothy Williams from New York.
WASHINGTON -- An outbreak of the avian flu virus in the United States could infect one-third of the population and kill as many as 1.9 million people, according to an analysis by the federal government released Wednesday.
There have been no reported cases of the virus being spread between humans.
The government analysis released Wednesday was part of a plan, broadly outlined by President Bush on Tuesday, to confront threats from new outbreaks of flu.
The analysis was based on previous flu pandemics in the United States in 1918, 1957 and 1968.
"When a pandemic virus strain emerges, 25 percent to 30 percent of the population could develop the clinical disease and a substantial fraction of those individuals could die," the report stated.
"The resources required for such a vigorous containment would almost certainly exceed those available in the affected communities."
The government analysis found that 40 percent of school age children could become sick with the virus, and between 865,000 and 9.9 million people would require hospitalizations -- depending on its severity -- a number that would threaten to overwhelm the hospital system.
The virus would affect a community for six to eight weeks and likely come in two different waves.
The report warned, however, that because such viruses quickly mutate, they are difficult to predict.
"The scope and pace of an influenza pandemic may defy accurate prediction," the report said.
"The disease may appear in many different parts of the nation almost simultaneously, or disease may occur in only one or a few communities, and if not contained there, proceed to affect other communities."
Concerns about pandemic flu have intensified in recent years with the spread of a deadly avian flu strain among birds in Asia that has decimated entire flocks.
This bird flu has infected about 120 people and killed 60.
But the virus has yet to pass easily among humans, as is necessary to create a pandemic.
Pandemic flu has struck the nation three times in the last century.
The first occasion, and the worst, was in 1918, when 500,000 people in the United States and 20 million worldwide died of what has since been identified as an avian flu.
But a pandemic flu could also result from unexpected genetic changes to the seasonal human flus that circle the globe and already cause about 36,000 deaths a year in the United States.
VIET-FLU-NYT
2 WHO DIED FROM AVIAN FLU IN VIETNAM WERE RESISTANT TO AN ANTI-VIRAL DRUG Andrew Pollack contributed reporting from Los Angeles for this article.
Two patients who died from avian influenza in Vietnam had developed resistance to the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, scientists are reporting Thursday.
The cases bring to three the number of Tamiflu-resistant cases among 138 people known to have been infected with the A (H5N1) avian influenza virus, according to the World Health Organization.
Of these, 71 have died.
All cases of human infection have been reported from Southeast Asia and with rare exception are believed to have resulted from contact with infected birds.
All three Tamiflu-resistant cases occurred in Vietnam.
The findings, which are being reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, show that the virus can rapidly mutate in certain patients to become Tamiflu resistant.
Tamiflu might need to be given in larger amounts and for longer than currently recommended for human influenza viruses, the report said.
It also said Tamiflu might need to be used in combination with other drugs in some cases.
There is no evidence that any kind of resistant avian influenza virus is being spread from person to person.
Rather, there may have been some particular reason why these individuals developed resistance.
Of the eight patients being reported Thursday, four survived and four died.
Among survivors, the amount of A (H5N1) influenza virus dropped rapidly to levels where tests could not detect it, presumably accounting for the patients' recovery.
In two of the fatal cases, the virus rapidly mutated to become Tamiflu resistant and overwhelm the body.
The remaining two patients died, possibly because they received Tamiflu too late to stop the virus from multiplying and causing its damage.
"The presence of detectable virus after the completion of treatment is associated with a poor outcome," said the team, which was headed by Dr.Menno D.de Jong of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City.
The team said its observations suggested that treatment with the recommended dose of Tamiflu, also known as oseltamivir, in some cases incompletely suppressed multiplication of the virus.
"Besides allowing the infection to proceed, such incomplete suppression provides opportunities for drug resistance to develop," de Jong's team reported.
Dr.David Reddy, an official of Roche, the Swiss manufacturer of Tamiflu, told reporters by telephone that the report underscored what scientists had learned about the drug's effects from studies in ferrets and other animals.
"We have to learn how to manage" A (H5N1) avian influenza in people, Reddy said.
Roche is conducting additional animal studies to "more closely mirror" the use of Tamiflu in outbreaks and is planning to collaborate with the WHO and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., to study people infected with A (H5N1), Reddy said.
Roche announced Wednesday that U.S. officials approved expanded marketing of Tamiflu to include preventing seasonal influenza among children ages 1 through 12.
In the past, Tamiflu has been approved for preventing infection in people ages 13 and older and for treating the infection in anyone 1 year old and older.
CALIFORNIA GOP APPARENTLY WAITS IN VAIN FOR MCCLINTOCK TO
Tom McClintock, the gun-owning, no-tax, no-nonsense Republican state senator from Ventura County, arrived early Thursday morning at a television studio in a taxpayer-subsidized car.
A preacher of governmental parsimony, he did come without driver or entourage.
He wore a blue suit, blue shirt and new shoes, bought the day before this occasion.
The news media was there to meet him.
An obscurE sdate politician just weeks ago, he is now the man to know, a Republican too conservative for thE Rupublicans.
Helium has been injected into McClintock's third-place campaign after the debate on Wednesday, in which he appeared knowledgeable and statesmanlike, the picture of conservative rectitude, at least in comparison to the ``I Love Lucy'' episode put on by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Arianna Huffington.
When he finally did here, McClintock, curiously, did not tag his fellow Republican as a rank amateur.
He did not try to push him into a corner on budgetary specifics.
Rather, both McClintock and Schwarzenegger seemed determined to present a united Republican front.
Many here assumed that McClintock had finally bowed to pressure from state and national Republicans to leave the race, to avoid splitting the vote and delivering the governor's seat to a Democrat.
But Thursday morning, McClintock, evoking Churchill, Lincoln, Disraeli and Franklin D. Roosevelt, made himself absolutely clear: He is in for the duration, period.
``People tell me all the time that you care more about your principles than you care about winning,'' McClintock said, claiming that an hour after the debates he rai win.
And secondly, if you don't stick to your principles, what is the point of winning?''
His friends have urged him to quit.
But the question is political pragmatism or remaining ideologically pure and irrelevant.
McClintock has spent his entire professional career in politics, save for a four-year stint at a think tank after a failed bid for Congress.
He has two children who attend public school in Sacramento, and says the root of his fiscal parsimony came from watching his mother fretting over bills at the kitchen table.
A self-described loner, he often finds himself the sole dissenting vote on legislation, and has not voted for a budget since 1990.
He is enjoying the limelight, by his own admission.
At the state Republican convention two weeks ago, McClintock stepped into a packed new media room with a dozen cameras.
His eyes flashed, his chest swelled like a water balloon.
The world was listening.
He was high on adrenaline.
``That's it exactly,'' McClintock said Thursday morning.
``It's been a pretty lonely business over the years.''
``On a much, much grander scale you saw the same thing with Churchill,'' he went on.
``He warned for years of the direction of British foreign policy.
Nobody listened, and the crisis came.
And when the crisis came, people began to listen and they responded, and that's what you're seeing on a much smaller scale here in Ca,ifNrnia.''
Nevertheless, with the establishment against him, he can expect little help in raising money.
He has scrounged up about $1.4 million.
Schwarzenegger has roughly $14 million, $6 million from his own pocket, and spends $2 million a week in television ads alone.
Returning Wednesday night's gesture of probity, Schwarzenegger's people did not speak ill of their fellow Republican on Thursday.
``They agree on virtually all the issues.
It's for Tom to make the decision.
The math is obvious.
If the field consolidates around Arnold, the odds of a Republican governorship greatly increase.''
With polls showing Schwarzenegger and Bustamante in a virtual tie, McClintock could swing the vote the Democrats' way.
He seems unconcerned, however, about damaging the party or his political future.
Instead, he clings to the notion that despite being outspent, he is creeping up in the polls, while Schwarzenegger is not.
``There is a certain herd instinct that plays out among pachyderms,'' McClintock said of the Republican establishment.
``You're seeing that now.
The people I have always appealed to are the rank-and-file voters of this state, and they have been responding from the very first day when I was an asterisk.''
This is the sort of talk that has driven McClintock's closest friends in government to abandon him.
Ray Haynes, a conservative*
Still, Haynes hopes there are no hard feelings.
``It is significant that he didn't attack Arnold last night.
He is out there giving his message, but has also left Arnold as an acceptable alternative for his supporters.
If he had turned on Arnold last night, the Republicans would have turned on him.''
FOR SCHWARZENEGGER, DEBATE RAISES SPECTER OF GENDER GAP
By CARLA MARINUCCIc.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE
Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, trying to make light of his cutting remarks to Arianna Huffington at Wednesday's gubernatorial debate, said Thursday he was only giving her a ``compliment'' when he told her, ``I have a perfect part for you in `Terminator 4''' and ``You need a little more decaf.''
The GOP front-runner in the recall election wanted to talk about the California economy and his platform at a town hall meeting in DoS$Angeles.
But Schwarzenegger was grilled by Fox Radio's Sean Hannity, the host of the meeting, about Huffington's reaction to the actor's comments.
She noted that the female lead in ``Terminator 3'' was the cyborg who got her head pushed into a toilet.
Because in `Terminator' we always had powerful women,'' Schwarzenegger responded.
``I had no idea that `the woman thing' would be an issue,'' Huffington, an Independent candidate for governor, said in an interview in San Francisco.
``He would not stop interrupting, and he expected me to be intimidated and cowed,'' she said.
With just 12 days left in the campaign, the fallout from the incident hqs folity that he might suffer on election day from a gender gap in which California women voters have favored Democrats.
The debate's back-and-forth between Arnold and Arianna also may represent one of those ``Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'' moments in politics _ highlighting the elusive differences in outlook and experience that separate male and female voters.
``A lot of men might have thought Arianna was competing for the Bitch Hall of Fame,'' said Mark Petracca, University of California at Irvine professor of political science.
``There are lots of situations out there in the real world where men are dismissive of any woman who is assertive.''
But for women voters, ``something like this exemplifies the worst possibility for Arnold: Gov.`Conan the Barbarian,''' he said, referring to one of the actor's early films.
She called it ``deja vu'' _ reviving all those times she'd been outnumbered by men in professional meetings.
``I don't remember (Arnold) doing it to any of the men.''
Even some men agreed.
But that's not how Richard Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, saw it.
``Oh, come on,'' said the moderate Republican, responding in mock horror when asked about the exchange.
Sean Walsh, spokesman for Schwarzenegger, downplayed the matter.
``You can't go out and say you want to be one thing to the public _ then be shocked and appalled when you're treated as an equal.''
Huffington on Thursday was asked repeatedly about the matter on the campaign trail, even as she attempted to introduce an initiative for public campaign financing in Sacramento.
And, as the only major female candidate for governor, Huffington advised that ``the women of California need to take a second look before they vote on Oct. 7.''
Not all women agreed, however _ and some took issue with Huffington's combative manner in the debate.
But for the actor-turned-candidate _ whom the latest Field Poll shows is suffering a 13-percentage-point gap among women voters _ the debate over the debate threatens his attempts to woo the women's vote.
For weeks, Schwarzenegger has wrestnel!with news stories about his attitudes toward women, including those about a 1977 interview with Oui Magazine in which he boasted of group sex and drug use _ stories he now says were inflated to promote his body building and the movie ``Pumping Iron.''
But after his debate performance, politicos and voters again were talking about Schwarzenegger's comments about ``Terminator 3'' to Entertainment Weekly.
``How many times do you get away with this, to take a woman, grab her upside down, and bury her face if the end, I didn't do it to a woman; she's a machine! We could get away with it without being crucified by who- knows-what group.''
The campaign has tried to use Schwarzenegger's wife, Maria Shriver, to reach out to women voters.
But pollster Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of California said Schwarzenegger's comments this week could still affect his chances on Oct 7.
``It didn't help (him) with the efforts that all Republicans need to make _ convincing women voters that he was a different type of Republican.''
'ARNOLD' PACKS MUSCLE, NOT CLARITY TV REVIEW; "SEE ARNOLD RUN"; SUNDAY ON A&amp;E; GRADE: C-  VEJNOSKA
Take this review with a grain of salt.
Appreciate?
Oh my, yes.
But do I understand how all that translated into the Austrian-born action hero becoming governor of California?
On his first try?
Over Gary Coleman?!
Nuh-uh.
I just knew he wouldn't defeat Gov.Gray Davis in 2003's recall race.
How could he?
He'd had some political experience championing a successful ballot initiative to fund after-school programs, but none as a candidate.
See?
Grain of salt.
Unfortunately, I'm not much the wiser after watching "See Arnold Run."
Arnold-centric to the point that it employs two actors (Jurgen Prochnow, Roland Kickinger) to portray him at different phases in his adult life (there's a kiddie Arnold, too), "See Arnold Run" muscles aside nearly any other significant characters.
Fellow candidate Arianna Huffington (Nora Dunn) does show up several times, but mostly as a heavily accented device for further enlarging the Schwarzenegger persona (Arnold shows concern and lightens the mood after she trips; Arnold puts her in her Chatty Cathy place at a debate).
Still, Huffington -- the real one -- has little to complain about compared with Barbara Walters (Kristen Shaw), who starts out annoyed at having to interview the little-known bodybuilder on the "Today Show" in 1974 and ends up completely in his thrall.
Schwarzenegger ad libs what sounds like a movie tagline at the campaign appearance that follows ("Where there's smoke, there's fire .. ."), unnerving his high-priced political advisers.
Or maybe it simply doesn't matter.
Maybe Schwarzenegger, with his big-screen aura of supreme confidence and don't-mess-with-me dialogue -- "I will pump up Sacramento," "It is time to terminate Gray Davis" -- was everything that California voters wanted to hear in such tumultuous, financially perilous times.
Maybe after all those years of playing roles, it was all the "Guvernator" knew how to do.
Or maybe he knew exactly what he was doing.
I vote for the latter.
But who knows?
For all its intense focus on the man, "See Arnold Run" never draws a clear bead on who its subject is or how he set the political world on its ear.
That's a shame, and, if the movement to amend the Constitution so he can run for president ever gains any traction, it could prove extremely shortsighted.
I may not understand much about Schwarzenegger, but I know you don't achieve all he has in the arenas of entertainment, business and, now, politics on big biceps alone.
It would've been nice to "see" a lot more of that Arnold here.

BC-TV-ARNOLD-SPI A&E DESERVES NO VOTES FOR 'SEE ARNOLD RUN'
Conceive it, believe it, achieve it.
But if you can't do it right, leave it.
Honestly, when A&E announced its intention to air a movie about Arnold's gubernatorial run within days of his winning the job, did anybody dream it would be a piece of art, or entertainment?
Heavens no.
Only, one would expect a smidgen more than the flat, two-hour slobbering kiss the channel's serving up Sunday at 8 p.m., even if it was directed by "American Pie 2's" J.B. Rogers.
The only thing that could be worse is if the movie actually had an Oprah impersonator as frightening as the actor portraying the Arnold of today.
"See Arnold Run" is supposed to illustrate the source of Schwarzenegger's irrepressible drive, likening the 60 days from his announced candidacy to the 2003 recall election to 60 days in 1974, when Arnold was training for his fourth "Mr.Olympia" title.
Along the way, the script throws in some black-and-white flashbacks to Arnold's getting socked in the face by his brother while competing for his father's love.
"Conan, what is best in life?"
"To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women!"
How true.
See, there are two central messages guiding "See Arnold Run."
The first concerns the all-importance of tenacity, observed in the young Arnold's hunger for success beyond all ideas of success, his mantra of being bigger, faster, stronger, his declaration to the world that he is Zeus.
The second is more cynical and coldly realistic, which is that -- with enough fame and money -- you can purchase your way into power, see Cruz Bustamante and Arianna Huffington crushed and driven before you and silence the lamentation of those you have groped.
As the film starts, none of Schwarzenegger's advisers believe he is going to run.
And yet he does, hiring the finest coaches and political wizards his millions can buy, making every obstacle mounted in his path -- mainly, his father's Nazi affiliation during World War II and numerous allegations that he had fondled women on movie sets -- disappear with a few well-scripted lines and a movie star smile.
Then again, consider the material.
Besides oiling up and putting together "Pumping Iron," all Kickinger had to do was make his nipples bounce around naughtily and appear determined whenever he hit an obstacle.
Prochnow, on the other hand, had to play a star he doesn't resemble in the least.
For example, how did he leap from the B-movie status afforded him by "Hercules Goes Bananas" to becoming "Conan the Barbarian" box-office force?
How did he land a member of the Kennedy clan, and how did her political affiliation and journalistic experience shape -- over the many years of their marriage -- his readiness to run?
On the other hand, if Schwarzenegger is truly considering a run for the White House -- following a constitutional amendment, that is -- he could ask for no better a propaganda film.
SCHWARZENEGGER SEVERS FINANCIAL TIES TO BODYBUILDING EVENT
Gov.Arnold Schwarzenegger has quietly severed his financial ties to the premiere bodybuilding event that bears his name -- the Arnold Classic -- following concerns about his outside business connections to the dietary supplements industry.
The governor decided last week to cut his financial ties with the Arnold Classic, a major sales forum for dietary supplement products, and its Ohio-based parent firm, Classic Productions, Schwarzenegger spokesman Rob Stutzman said Friday.
The decision follows a move to end a $5 million-plus contract with two leading bodybuilding magazines, Muscle &amp; Fitness and Flex, which rely heavily on supplement advertising and are published by American Media Inc.
"To make it clear, just like the (American Media Inc.) deal, he's not going to take anything from the Classic anymore either," Stutzman said.
The amount Schwarzenegger earned from the Arnold Classic is unclear, but his decision on the event effectively cuts another monetary link with the sales and promotion of dietary supplements, an issue that has dogged his administration since he vetoed a bill last year that would have banned some dietary supplements among high school athletes.
"I think the governor has realized over the past week that receiving outside income as a sitting governor is problematic," said state Sen.Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough, author of the bill Schwarzenegger vetoed.
"He seems to realize that being an elected official is different from being a movie star."
The latest development came to light after The Chronicle questioned why the governor changed the way he accounted for the income from the Arnold Classic on his most recent economic disclosure form.
Because of the reporting changes, dietary supplement-makers like Muscle Tech, Prolab, and SportPharma, listed by name on his 2003 financial disclosure statements, disappeared from the 2004 forms -- even though they continued to pump money and advertising into the Arnold Classic.
Both Stutzman and Paul Wachter, the governor's chief financial adviser, said Friday that the differences in accounting between Schwarzenegger's statements of economic interest were not an attempt to disguise the governor's financial dealings, but merely to reflect recent legal changes in his relationship with his former partner in the Arnold Classic, Jim Lorimer.
The governor's 2003 public statement of economic interest lists three specific income-producing business entities and trusts -- Oak Productions, the Santa Monica firm established to manage his movie-related images, intellectual property rights and products; Main Street Plaza Inc., his Santa Monica-based real estate holdings; and Classic Productions Inc., Schwarzenegger's partnership that has produced the annual Arnold Classic.
The filing for 2003 indicates that Schwarzenegger's Classic Productions specifically received income from dozens of major dietary supplement-makers and retailers, such as GNC, Labrada Nutrition, Optimum Nutrition, VPX and Pinnacle.
But those sources are no longer included in the governor's statement for 2004, the most recent on file.
Instead, Classic Productions is now merely listed under the umbrella of Oak Productions as an income-producing entity, with no further details provided.
The changes came even though Schwarzenegger's high-profile role as a salesman for body enhancing products and an industry icon was clearly on display at this year's 2005 Classic in Columbus, Ohio.
The governor was mobbed by thousands of fans at the March event, and for nearly three days made the rounds, visiting booths and posing for photos with product sponsors, hawkers, fans, athletes and buyers.
But Wachter said that change was made to accurately reflect the period after Schwarzenegger's election, when most of his assets there were moved into a blind trust and he shifted from a partnership to a "license deal" with Lorimer.
"In the old days, he got a handshake that basically he owned half of the (Classic Productions) deal," Wachter said.
This year, the governor received what Wachter said was a "license fee" from Classic Productions to Oak Productions -- though he acknowledged that "our income is all the same stuff, obviously ...
it's the booths, and the television money, whatever they get."
"When I was on the Fair Political Practices Commission, we talked a lot about 'piercing the veil,"' said Tony Quinn, a GOP consultant who was on the commission from 1976 to 1981.
"If you have income, you have to show where it comes from."
While the 2004 statement of economic interests shows that Schwarzenegger is still receiving income from Classic Productions, that money is now being paid to Oak Productions, his wholly owned company, rather than directly to the governor.
"By adding that new level, you effectively hid the source of those funds," said Larry Noble of the Center for Responsive Politics.
"If you can hide the source of money, it's as good as if you had no disclosure at all."
"It never dawned on us to think about things like hiding something, because we were so concerned about doing everything legally.
The No.1 overarching concern is to follow the rules, which are extremely complicated," Wachter said.
I think we have."
Both Stutzman and Wachter stressed that Schwarzenegger will "absolutely" continue to attend the Arnold Classic, but they insist, however, that he will do it as a labor of love -- and not for money.
"The fact is, when somebody spends from 1965 to 2005, which is 40 years, in which he has never stopped promoting the bodybuilding industry and the business, he doesn't give a s-- about the money," said Wachter.
"It's not about the money.
It never was.
It never is.
It never will be. ...
4 DIE IN ACCIDENT AT JAPANESE NUCLEAR PLANT
Blasts of nonradioactive steam killed four workers and severely burned seven others Monday in the first fatal accident at a Japanese nuclear power plant, officials said.
"Radioactive materials weren't contained in the steam that leaked out," an official for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said at a news conference here.
"We've received a report that there is no impact from radiation on the surrounding environment."
With no official concern over radioactive contamination from the 28-year-old plant, there was no evacuation from the nearby town of Mihama, home to 11,000 people on the Sea of Japan, about 40 miles north of Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital.
With the world's third-largest nuclear power industry, after the United States and France, Japan relies on nuclear power to generate almost a third of its electricity.
Fifty-two nuclear power plants operate in the country.
Heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East, Japan has moved aggressively over the past year to work with Russia to explore oil and gas deposits in Siberia.
Wariness has been fueled by accidents and by a culture of cover-ups where employees have shown a far higher loyalty to their companies than to the public's right to know.
Last summer, the Tokyo Electric Power Co.was forced to temporarily close all 17 of its nuclear power plants after admitting it had faked safety reports for more than a decade.
"After the Tepco scandal of two years ago, today's accident would accelerate people's worry and suspicion about the safety management of the nuclear power plants," Satoshi Fujino, a staffer at Citizens' Nuclear Information Center, a private nuclear-power watchdog organization, said in an interview Monday.
"This plant is pretty old, and there are many plants even older."
The accident Monday took place in the turbine building of the No.3 nuclear reactor in Mihama, which was commissioned in November 1976 by the Kansai Electric Power Co.
In the accident, steam believed to measure about 200 degrees celsius, or nearly 390 degrees fahrenheit, spewed into a room just after workers entered to take measurements before a scheduled maintenance shutdown, NHK television reported.
According to the Japanese nuclear safety official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, it would be impossible for the leaked steam to contain radioactivity as the water in the steam turbines does not come into contact with water used to cool the nuclear reactor.
Kansai Electric Power said it shut the 826,000-kilowatt nuclear generation unit at the facility and was unsure when it would restart.
"We are now investigating the cause," a Kansai Electric official said at a news conference.
"This incident will have no radiation effect on the surrounding environment," the company said in statement.
The company said two other reactors in the Mihama complex, about 200 miles west of Tokyo, were operating normally.
Hiroshi Matsumura, managing director of Kansai Electric, apologized.
"To those who were injured and to the public, we apologize."
The accident took place on the anniversary of the nuclear bombing of Nagasaki in World War II, and political and industry leaders were quick to assure that a thorough investigation would take place.

The only other fatalities in the nuclear power industry in Japan took place in 1999, at a fuel reprocessing plant in Tokaimura, northeast of Tokyo.
A radiation leak killed two workers, exposed 600 people to low levels of radiation and led to the evacuation of thousands of local residents.
That accident was caused by three workers who tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium in buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks.
It exposed more than 600 people to radiation and forced about 320,000 to take shelter indoors for more than a day.
Two of the workers who set off the disaster later died from their injuries.
More recently, in February, eight workers were exposed to low-level radiation at another power plant when they were accidentally sprayed with contaminated water.
The doses were not considered dangerous.
CORROSION CITED IN PIPE THAT BURST AT NUCLEAR PLANT
A steam pipe that blew out Monday, killing four workers at a Japanese nuclear power plant, had not been inspected in 28 years and had corroded from nearly half an inch to a thickness little greater than metal foil, the authorities said Tuesday.
Although the carbon steel pipe carried 300-degree steam at high pressure, it had not been inspected since the power plant opened in 1976.
In April 2003, Nihon Arm, a maintenance subcontractor, informed Kansai Electric Power Co., the plant owner, that there could be a problem.
Last November, the power company scheduled an ultrasound inspection for Aug. 14.
"We thought we could postpone the checks until this month," Akira Kokado, the deputy plant manager, told reporters at Mihama.
The police opened an investigation Tuesday to determine why 221 workers were in the reactor facility at the time of the accident.
The subcontractor has said the workers were preparing for Friday's inspection shutdown.
On Monday, four days before the scheduled shutdown, superheated steam blew a 2-foot-wide hole in the pipe, fatally scalding four workmen and injuring five others seriously.
The steam that escaped had not been in contact with the nuclear reactor, and no nuclear contamination has been reported.
Initial measurements showed that the steam had corroded the pipe from .4 inches to .06 inches, less than one-third the minimum safety standard.
Kansai Electric said in a statement Tuesday that the pipe showed "large-scale corrosion."
"We conducted visual inspections, but never made ultrasonic tests, which can measure the thickness of a steel pipe," Haruo Nakano, a Kansai Electric spokesman, told reporters.
In response to the accident, Japan's Nuclear and Industry Safety Agency ordered four other power companies that own nuclear plants with the same type of pressurized water reactors to conduct ultrasound inspections of their pipes.
The inspections are to involve nearly half of the country's 52 nuclear power plants.
The Kyodo news agency reported Wednesday that corrosion problems had prompted operators in recent years to replace the steam pipes at 16 plants of a design similar to that of the plant at Mihama.
After television news helicopters swarmed over the plant on Monday, government officials jumped Tuesday to assure the public that a full investigation will take place.
But government leaders also tried to bolster flagging public support for nuclear power.
"Nuclear power has a significant impact in our lives," Koizumi told reporters Tuesday.
Japan has the world's third-largest nuclear power industry, after the United States and France.
The government has planned to build 11 more reactors this decade, increasing the nation's reliance on home-based nuclear power to 40 percent of electricity needs.
Already slowed by local opposition, this program may now be stalled by the accident, the most deadly in the history of nuclear power in Japan.

"This accident seriously damaged public confidence in nuclear safety and our nuclear measures."
SECOND NUCLEAR PLANT IN THE WORKS
Spurred by customer growth, rising conventional fuel costs and a pronuclear stance by the Bush administration, Progress Energy Florida may build a second nuclear power plant in Florida, with rural counties in Central Florida providing some of the most attractive options for a site.
If the St.Petersburg utility proceeds with such plans, the new plant would become Florida's first new nuclear generation project since 1983, when Florida Power &amp; Light opened a second reactor at its St.Lucie nuclear complex near Fort Pierce.
In 1977, Progress Energy, then known as Florida Power Corp., began operating its first and only nuclear power plant at its Crystal River complex in Citrus County.
By the end of this year, Progress' corporate parent, Progress Energy Inc.of Raleigh, N.C., expects to select a potential site and design for a nuclear plant to meet the growing electricity demands of its expanding customer base.
Altogether, Progress operates four nuclear facilities in the Carolinas and Florida.
Central Florida is high on Progress Energy's list of potential sites.
A location in Polk, Seminole, Osceola or Highlands counties would put a nuclear power plant closer to major transmission lines in the state.
And while Pinellas and Pasco counties account for the greatest portion of electricity demand in the company's Florida service territory, Central Florida is experiencing the greatest customer growth, a key consideration when siting a power plant.
Choosing a site and vendor for a nuclear plant is among the first formal steps of a lengthy license application process that could take years.
For now, a nuclear plant appears to be the most likely expansion option for Progress, although company officials do not rule out the possibility that the company will eventually decide to build a plant powered by coal instead.
The complex already includes four large coal-fired generating units producing more than 3,000 megawatts of electricity.
Adding a second nuclear reactor to the site would mean that "you're putting a lot of generation at one location," he said.
But building a nuclear power plant in a new location - and bringing with it the prospect of storing highly radioactive nuclear waste on site - could pose a formidable political challenge.
Another challenge: Nuclear power plants require a nearby water source for cooling, an additional hurdle away from Florida's coastline.
Habermeyer acknowledged that building on a new site will inevitably trigger some opposition.
Soaring gas, oil and coal prices have sent electricity prices soaring, further reducing consumers' longstanding resistance to nuclear power.
"Ultimately, you have to have a generating source that can provide sufficient electricity to power this country," he said.
Construction of a plant could begin in five years, with the plant becoming operational as early as 2015.
Progress' nuclear ambitions come at a pivotal time for the U.S. nuclear power industry, which has long operated under a pall of safety concerns since the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Harrisburg, Pa.
In fact, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not issued a license for a new nuclear reactor since then.
But the prospects for U.S. nuclear power generation have grown rosier under the Bush administration.
In a bid to encourage applications to build and operate nuclear plants, the Energy Department offered in some cases to pay up to half the cost of applying for the required license, which can run into hundreds of millions of dollars.
In addition, President Bush signed long-delayed energy legislation in August that provides production tax credits, loan guarantees and risk protections for companies building nuclear reactors.
Progress executives have unusually deep roots in nuclear power.
Habermeyer, Progress Energy Inc.chairman and chief executive Bob McGehee and retired chairman and chief executive Bill Cavanaugh are all veterans of the U.S. Navy's nuclear submarine program.
Still, nuclear is not the expansion choice of every power company.
Florida Power &amp; Light of Juno Beach, the state's larger nuclear power plant operator, recently decided against a new nuclear generator.
Instead, it has proposed building a coal plant in St.Lucie County.
FLIGHTS FROM TAIWAN TO MAINLAND SIGNAL SOFTER TONE FROM BEIJING
China struck a more conciliatory posture toward Taiwan on Friday and offered to restart diplomatic talks, an overture that came on the eve of the first direct flights between the island and the mainland since the Communist Party took power in 1949.
"What we care about is the policies he pursues and his attitude toward the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the strait."
In the past, Chinese officials have often refused to use Chen's name.
Talks between China and Taiwan collapsed in 1999, and a tense political stalemate has prevailed in recent years.
Jia's speech, at the Great Hall of the People, was timed to mark the 10th anniversary of a policy proposal on Taiwan reunification by Jiang Zemin, the former president of China.
The speech also came as the new direct flights have been generating excitement and a measure of optimism on both sides.
The charter flights are temporary and will be offered for only the next three weeks, as China celebrates the Lunar New Year.
The first flight is to leave Beijing on Saturday morning.
China's state media have promoted the flights as a major milestone.
Newspapers are filled with articles and photographs of flight attendants modeling new uniforms or practicing skits to entertain passengers.
The flights will take off from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and land in Taiwan's capital, Taipei, and in Kaohsiung.
The 24 flights will be equally divided between six Taiwanese and six Chinese carriers, with the final flight scheduled for Feb. 20.
Until now, travelers flying between China and Taiwan have been forced to land at a third location, usually Hong Kong or Macau, and then take off again.
Under the new arrangement, the flights must still pass through Hong Kong airspace, a significant detour, but are not required to land.
He added: "The economies of both sides are getting closer and more integrated."
Indeed, Taiwan businesses have invested tens of billions of dollars in building factories in China.
But he also repeated the now-familiar warning that China would risk even its booming economy to keep Taiwan from claiming independence.
CHINA LEADER MIXES RHETORIC ON TAIWAN
Hu Jintao, China's Communist Party chief, took a militant stance on Friday against what he called "secessionist forces" in Taiwan, but also cited "new and positive factors" that could reduce cross-strait tensions.
His comments came as China's national legislature prepared to consider a measure that would likely mandate a military response if Taiwan, which is governed independently, formally seceded from mainland China.
The measure is the culmination of a show of resolve by Hu after he became China's military leader late last year.
Delivering the main opening address to the legislature, called the National People's Congress, on Saturday morning, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao set an economic growth target of 8 percent, down from the 9.5 percent growth recorded in 2004.
He also vowed to eliminate the main tax imposed on China's peasantry for the first time in two millenniums.
The government also announced that it would raise spending on China's rapidly modernizing military by 12.6 percent in 2005, continuing a long streak of double-digit increases in outlays for military personnel and arms.
The comments appeared to underscore his plan to pass a so-called anti-secession law.
But he did not mention the legislation, describe its contents, or discuss the merits of enacting it.
Instead, he struck a relatively moderate tone, perhaps reflecting the fact that Taiwan and China, under heavy American pressure, have softened their rivalry since Hu first broached the idea of an anti-secession law in December.
Chen's party failed to gain a majority of seats in Taiwanese legislative elections in December.
Since then, Taiwan and China have agreed to expand holiday charter flights between Taiwan and the mainland.
Chen also made a political pact with James Soong, who heads an opposition party that favors reunification with China.
Hu seemed to signal that he was willing to open a dialogue with Chen, though only under the strict conditions China has set for talks for many years -- that Taiwan accept the "one China" formula under which Beijing claims sovereignty over Taiwan.
"No matter who he is and which political party it is, and no matter what they said and did in the past, we're willing to talk with them on issues of developing cross-strait relations and promoting peaceful reunification as long as they recognize the one-China principle," Hu said.
The comments do not amount to a substantive concession and may be overshadowed by passage of an anti-secession law, which both Taiwan and the United States have called a provocation.
But the tone of the comments suggest that Hu is probing for an improvement in relations.
(STORY CAN END HERE.

Taiwan is one focus of the Congress, the Communist Party-controlled legislature that convenes in full session once each year to review and invariably approve the main personnel appointments and policy decisions of party leaders.
Wen, the prime minister, delivering the government's equivalent of the State of the Union address on Saturday morning, emphasized continuing a campaign to cool China's economy and narrow the growing urban-rural wealth gap, which has led to severe social tensions.
He raised the official growth target from 7 percent in 2004 to 8 percent in 2005.
But the target is usually treated as a floor, not a ceiling.
With growth turning out to be a raging 9.5 percent last year, Wen now seems determined to slow it to 8 percent this year.
The central government is concerned about wasteful investment and reckless lending by state banks, practices that have powered growth but risk high inflation or even a financial collapse.
Wen said the government would tame fixed-asset investment, reducing the growth rate of investment to 16 percent in 2005 from nearly 28 percent in 2004.
He also pledged to trim the government budget deficit and issue fewer state bonds.
Wen also promised to address divisive social issues that have threatened to tear apart Chinese society.
There were thousands of large protests and several mass riots last year, many of them over land seizures, unpaid wages and corruption.
"Some low-income people lead difficult lives and there are more than a few factors threatening social stability."
He said he would abolish the main taxes on farmers, a majority of China's 1.3 billion people, for the first time in modern Chinese history.
The main tax will disappear by 2006, two years faster than earlier promised, he said.
He also outlined new programs to extend aid and reduce education fees for rural students.
Wen said he would work to curtail the conversion of farmland to commercial development, the major source of discontent for peasants, who have little control over the land they farm.
But he did not address fundamental land reform, which many analysts say is required to limit corruption and ease discontent.
$ADV14
If the members of the American medical establishment were to have a collective find-yourself-standing-naked-in-Times-Square-type nightmare, this might be it.
Or maybe it's this: They find that their very own dietary recommendations _ eat less fat and more carbohydrates _ are the cause of the rampaging epidemic of obesity in America.
Or, just possibly this: They find out both of the above are true.
When Atkins first published his ``Diet Revolution'' in 1972, Americans were just coming to terms with the proposition that fat _ particularly the saturated fat of meat and dairy products _ was the primary nutritional evil in the American diet.
Thirty years later, America has become weirdly polarized on the subject of weight.
On the one hand, we've been told with almost religious certainty by everyone from the surgeon general on down, and we have come to believe with almost religious certainty, that obesity is caused by the excessive consumption of fat, and that if we eat less fat we will lose weight and live longer.
On the other, we have the ever-resilient message of Atkins and decades' worth of best-selling diet books, including ``The Zone,'' ``Sugar Busters'' and ``Protein Power'' to name a few.
All push some variation of what scientists would call the alternative hypothesis:
It's not the fat that makes us fat, but the carbohydrates, and if we eat less carbohydrates we will lose weight and live longer.
The perversity of this alternative hypothesis is that it identifies the cause of obesity as precisely those refined carbohydrates at the base of the famous Food Guide Pyramid _ the pasta, rice and bread _ that we are told should be the staple of our healthy low-fat diet, and then on the sugar or corn syrup in the soft drinks, fruit juices and sports drinks that we have taken to consuming in quantity if for no other reason than that they are fat free and so appear intrinsically healthy.
Over the past five years, however, there has been a subtle shift in the scientific consensus.
It used to be that even considering the possibility of the alternative hypothesis, let alone researching it, was tantamount to quackery by association.
Now a small but growing minority of establishment researchers have come to take seriously what the low-carb-diet doctors have been saying all along.
Walter Willett, chairman of the department of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health, may be the most visible proponent of testing this heretic hypothesis.
Willett is the de facto spokesman of the longest-running, most comprehensive diet and health studies ever performed, which have already cost upward of $100 million and include data on nearly 300,000 individuals.
Those data, says Willett, clearly contradict the low-fat-is-good-health message ``and the idea that all fat is bad for you; the exclusive focus on adverse effects of fat may have contributed to the obesity epidemic.''
In particular, that we are in the midst of an obesity epidemic that started around the early 1980s, and that this was coincident with the rise of the low-fat dogma.
(Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, also rose significantly through this period.)
They say that low-fat weight-loss diets have proved in clinical trials and real life to be dismal failures, and that on top of it all, the percentage of fat in the American diet has been decreasing for two decades.
Our cholesterol levels have been declining, and we have been smoking less, and yet the incidence of heart disease has not declined as would be expected.
Put simply, if the alternative hypothesis is right, then a low-fat diet is not by definition a healthy diet.
In practice, such a diet cannot help being high in carbohydrates, and that can lead to obesity, and perhaps even heart disease.
``They have the paradoxical effect of making people gain weight.''
What's forgotten in the current controversy is that the low-fat dogma itself is only about 25 years old.
Until the late '70s, the accepted wisdom was that fat and protein protected against overeating by making you sated, and that carbohydrates made you fat.
Over the next two decades, however, the scientific evidence supporting this theory remained stubbornly ambiguous.
The case was eventually settled not by new science but by politics.
In the intervening years, the NIH spent several hundred million dollars trying to demonstrate a connection between eating fat and getting heart disease and, despite what we might think, it failed.
If nothing else, it effectively ignores the fact that unsaturated fats, like olive oil, are relatively good for you:
They tend to elevate your good cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lower your bad cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), at least in comparison to the effect of carbohydrates.
While higher LDL raises your heart-disease risk, higher HDL reduces it.
What this means is that even saturated fats _ aka, the bad fats _ are not nearly as deleterious as you would think.
True, they will elevate your bad cholesterol, but they will also elevate your good cholesterol.
In other words, it's a virtual wash.
As Willett explained to me, you will gain little to no health benefit by giving up milk, butter and cheese and eating bagels instead.
But it gets even weirder than that.
Foods considered more or less deadly under the low-fat dogma turn out to be comparatively benign if you actually look at their fat content.
More than two-thirds of the fat in a porterhouse steak, for instance, will definitively improve your cholesterol profile (at least in comparison with the baked potato next to it); it's true that the remainder will raise your LDL, the bad stuff, but it will also boost your HDL.
The same is true for lard.
If you work out the numbers, you come to the surreal conclusion that you can eat lard straight from the can and conceivably reduce your risk of heart disease.
The major trends in American diets since the late '70s, according to the USDA agricultural economist Judith Putnam, have been a decrease in the percentage of fat calories and a ``greatly increased consumption of carbohydrates.''
To be precise, annual grain consumption has increased almost 60 pounds per person, and caloric sweeteners (primarily high-fructose corn syrup) by 30 pounds.
At the same time, we suddenly began consuming more total calories: now up to 400 more each day since the government started recommending low-fat diets.
If these trends are correct, then the obesity epidemic can certainly be explained by Americans' eating more calories than ever _ excess calories, after all, are what causes us to gain weight _ and, specifically, more carbohydrates.
Atkins' diet is the battleground on which the fat-vs.-carbohydrates controversy is likely to be fought scientifically over the next few years.
Through the '60s, this had been a subject of considerable research, with the conclusion that Atkins-like diets were low-calorie diets in disguise; that when you cut out pasta, bread and potatoes, you'll have a hard time eating enough meat, vegetables and cheese to replace the calories.
None of these studies have been financed by the NIH, and none have yet been published.
But the results have been reported at conferences.
The results of all five of these studies done thus far are remarkably consistent.
Subjects on some form of the Atkins diet lost twice the weight as the subjects on the low-fat, low-calorie diets.
In all five studies, cholesterol levels improved similarly with both diets, but triglyceride levels were considerably lower with the Atkins diet.
Though researchers are hesitant to agree with this, it does suggest that heart-disease risk could actually be reduced when fat is added back into the diet and starches and refined carbohydrates are removed.
All of this could be settled sooner rather than later, and with it, perhaps, we might have some long-awaited answers as to why we grow fat and whether it is indeed preordained by societal forces or by our choice of foods.
For the first time, the NIH is now actually financing comparative studies of popular diets.
In the course of my research, I have spent my mornings at my local diner, staring down at a plate of scrambled eggs and sausage, convinced that somehow, some way, they must be working to clog my arteries and do me in.
I have even lost considerable weight with relative ease by giving up carbohydrates on my test diet, and yet I can look down at my eggs and sausage and still imagine the imminent onset of heart disease and obesity.
This is the state of mind I imagine that mainstream nutritionists, researchers and physicians must inevitably take to the fat-vs.-carbohydrate controversy.
They may come around, but the evidence will have to be exceptionally compelling.

EATING WELL: FILLING YOU UP WITH DIET IDEAS
Every 10 years or so, it seems, the nation's anxiety over dieting builds to a peak and a realization hits home: Whatever weight-loss program has so recently captivated us is wrong.
Fat might be good for us now, some people say, and carbohydrates bad.
Not so long ago, the opposite was true.
Probably it will be again.
These things tend to work as pendulums do.
Diet fads and government guidelines over the last quarter century have not helped to produce a slimmer America.
We are a fatter nation now, on average, than we were in the 1970s.
What diet fads have given us are short-term losses and long-term gains because few if any of them emphasize a key fact: If you consume more calories than you expend, you will gain weight.
Despite what the opposing sides in this long-running debate assert, it doesn't make much difference where the calories come from.
A successful dieter needs to burn them.
At the two poles of the current debate over diet are the protein- and fat-rich Atkins diet and the high-fiber, low-fat program put forward by Dr. Dean Ornish.
In the middle sits the Agriculture Department's Food Guide Pyramid, which tells consumers to reduce fats, but allows them to increase carbohydrates significantly.
The Atkins diet doesn't seem to restrict calories.
In fact it does.
The diet makes it difficult to eat as many calories as one gets from the carbohydrates that contain no fiber: sugar, white flour, pasta and the like.
Filled with steak, in other words, you're simply too ``full'' to eat dessert.
The Ornish diet is at the other extreme, saying you can eat all you want, but only of foods very low in fat and very high in fiber, making it a low-calorie diet because fiber acts like fat.
It fills you up.
It all seems very simple: Eat fat and protein (Atkins) and a process takes place that most of us don't understand, and you lose weight.
Barely eat any fat and stick to complex carbohydrates and the weight will pour off (Ornish).
In both cases it will, at least for the short term; there are no studies to show whether the Atkins diet, in particular, is safe over a lifetime.
Ornish's diet is designed mainly for people who have clogged arteries or have had heart attacks.
Using his strict regimen, some of these people have been able to reverse the course of heart disease.
Whether the diet is the most desirable for people who are simply overweight has not been determined.
There are no lifetime studies.
Caught directly between these two diet extremes is the Food Guide Pyramid, which tells us that fat should be reduced to 30 percent of calories consumed, and that carbohydrates should be increased significantly.
It does not, however, distinguish clearly enough between complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits and vegetables and refined ones like sugar.
Refined carbohydrates turn into blood glucose quite quickly, which in turn drives up insulin production, which lowers blood sugar and _ guess what? _ makes us hungry again.
The result is one of unintended consequences.
Since the late 1980s this government-approved diet appears to have provided people with permission to eat as many carbohydrates as they want, no matter the source.
And many of them have.
Over the last 10 or 15 years people not only have continued to consume the same amount of fat but they have also added 200 to 400 calories more a day from carbohydrates.
The result is what experts are describing as an epidemic of obesity.
With the two hats that it wears _ one to protect consumer health and the other to help farmers sell food _ it cannot tell us to eat fewer calories.
That would fly in the face of its mandate to help farmers.
There is another unintended consequence of the government's advice.
``They knew exactly what to do with it.
They said, `You want us to sell foods that are low fat or no fat?
Sure, but you didn't say anything about calories!'
And so the calories remained the same.''
Remember Snackwells, the wildly popular cookie of the 1990s?
It had no fat but plenty of refined carbohydrates.
The ``no fat'' label made many people think it was all right to eat an entire box.
In one sitting.
No fat, but the cookies still had plenty of calories; they just came from a different source.
At the same time that people increased their consumption of carbs, serving sizes were rising dramatically.
Mindy Hermann, a registered dietician in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said: ``Everything is supersized.
A single serving of a soft drink was once six ounces; today it is 20 ounces.
A bagel no longer weighs two ounces; it weighs four or six.
Hamburgers come in double and triple sizes with two buns, twice as much cheese and a high-calorie sauce.''
``The average American child sees 10,000 food ads on television each year,'' he said.
There are places you never expected to eat, Brownell said, like gas stations and drug stores and shopping malls.
Snack food and soft drink machines are installed in American schools, even as physical education in schools is waning.
Add to these difficulties Brownell's view of a toxic environment in which food is shoved at people from every angle.
As ever, losing weight is not easy.
Keeping it off is even harder.
SWEETIE, WHO'S SLIMMING YOU THIS SEASON?
You can stare all day at the stylists, photographers and designers who will be flocking in and out of the Bryant Park tents for the New York fashion shows this week and still miss the accessory of the season.
It's not some luscious, tangible object like Marc Jacobs' vintage-looking military jacket with chevrons and pewter buttons.
The accessory of the moment is the diet.
In the front row and backstage, count on the chatter to be peppered with talk of points and portions.
Text messages will fly with the titles of diet books and ``natural'' appetite suppressants like Xenadrine and Hydroxycut.
The names and numbers of obscure doctors will be scribbled messily inside Smythson leather-bound notebooks.
And in some Celine Boogie bags, you might find a stainless-steel thermos of bancha twig tea, a Japanese concoction favored by macrobiotic eaters, who take great pains to explain that they are balancing their acidity with a judicious splash of alkaline.
Or something.
Like label groupies devoted slavishly to one designer for a season before moving on to the next hot thing, fashion and Hollywood folk have fallen for fad diets and are enticing friends to join them.
They are creating mini-societies, each with a common devotion to one regime, and along with it the giddy sense of being in on something new, of belonging to a group that's cool.
Can there be any news in the fact that fashion and body-obsessed celebrities are chattering about diets?
The real stop-the-presses story would be if the fashionistas gathering this week in New York for their semiannual round of designer shows and latte bingeing had renounced their quasi-pathological obsession with weight.
Diets have always been woven into the life of the image-conscious, but it used to be something you didn't admit _ like the model ``sent away'' to drop 5 pounds before she could work again.
Now diets are discussed openly, unashamedly, cheerfully.
Having a diet is almost ...de rigueur.
``Diets had a connotation of shame before,'' said Brana Wolf, a prominent fashion stylist.
``Now it's, like, Hey, who's your doctor?
Today it's a swapping of information like never before.''
The latest trend among the style-setters and celebrities is to claim membership in a diet tribe _ a group whose individuals happily share their shortcuts, chemical-free protein bars and secret splurges.
While Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna were performing onstage in London last season, they bonded over a macrobiotic regimen featuring the green bancha twig tea.
Jennifer Aniston reportedly turned the cast of ``Friends'' on to her Zone program.
The model Amber Valetta and Orlando Pita, a hairstylist, have introduced a bevy of fashion pals, including the designer Narciso Rodriguez and the photographer Steven Meisel, to a New York chiropractor and nutritionist named Charles Passler.
``Because somebody says it works, other people try it,'' Nestle said.
It's not a normal eating pattern to exclude whole food groups from what you eat, so you eventually stop and gain the weight back and start all over again.''
Unlike the situation in fashion, where innovation is the relentless mantra, the most popular diets aren't necessarily the newest ones.
Despite the endless stream of newfangled ways to count calories and cut fat, it's the vintage systems like Weight Watchers, the Atkins program, macrobiotic diets and even Dolly Parton's program of eating many tiny meals that seem to have the strongest pull.
Maybe that is because, just like fashion trends, diets slip in and out of vogue.
And, just like the Marc Jacobs military jacket, the vintage aspect of a diet can hold a lot of appeal.
``It's funny that these old-school diets keep coming back,'' said Angela Mariani, a fashion publicist who has done the 20-year-old Herbalife diet twice.
``People remember their mothers doing Atkins.''
These days Atkins, whose protein diet allows the consumption of fat but not carbohydrates, is experiencing a somewhat triumphant revival: the latest edition of his 1972 book, updated and retitled ``Dr.Atkins' New Diet Revolution,'' has been hovering at or near the top of The New York Times' list of best-selling advice, how-to and miscellaneous paperbacks for 275 weeks.
The Atkins method isn't the only one that has captivated the fashion and Hollywood crowds.
Thanks to Rosie O'Donnell and her former publicist Jennifer Glaisek, Weight Watchers has also gripped Hollywood.
Over a year ago, O'Donnell conscripted her entire staff to follow the regime as she did so herself and discussed it on the air.
Soon a dozen of Glaisek's colleagues at the powerful public relations firm of PMK/HBH were also showing up for weekly weigh-ins at the offices of the ``Rosie'' show.
``It was the visual of Jennifer Glaisek,'' said Toby Fleischman, a PMK/HBH publicist who joined the group.
I did Weight Watchers when I was 14, and it was a very humiliating experience, but this time Rosie was often at the meetings, and there was a great sense of camaraderie.''
The group, all women, stuck together in the Weight Watchers meetings for only about six months, just long enough to squeeze into Seven low-rider jeans.
Like fashion trends, diet tribes often maintain a life span of only that long.
``It died off around the holidays,'' Fleischman said.
``The career lifestyle of a publicist just isn't that conducive to the points system.''
But as with any trend, denim or otherwise, there is always something new to move along to, even if it isn't necessarily so new.
The Zone, a diet created by Dr.Barry Sears in the late 1980s and introduced to a wider public in a best-selling book in 1995, has kept a firm grip on a group of Hollywood devotees for seven years.
The only problem is that after a while, some people grow sick of the food.
``Anyway, I hear Sugar Busters is on its way back,'' he said of a diet that restricts sugar and refined carbohydrates.
``It's the Dolly Parton portion control diet,'' he said.
``You just eat fist-size portions of the food you'd normally eat.
It's a very 1950s way of eating.''
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
Not everyone following a diet is trying to lose weight.
Many fashion professionals and celebrities seek out diet doctors or nutritionists for advice on how they can eliminate stress, stop smoking or generally change an unhealthy lifestyle.
That was the case for Gwyneth Paltrow, who, after five bouts with a nasty flu virus, decided it was time to take steps.
Her yoga teacher, Eddie Stern, recommended a nutritionist who prescribed a macrobiotic diet.
``I was working on `Possession' in London at the time,'' Paltrow said.
``And it's very hard to avoid dairy and meat there, so I had all this stuff brought over, and it happened to be macrobiotic.
SIZING UP THE TOP DIETS
Don't you know it's the season of New Year's resolutions?
Promises to the self to abstain from unhealthy behavior and to be a better person?
Or maybe lose a few pounds and eat healthy?
Or heck, maybe just try not to gain another five pounds this year?
Easier said than done, no doubt, especially once you brush the doughnut crumbs off the front of your shirt and take a stroll down the diet and fitness aisle of your neighborhood bookstore.
One book tells you to eat fat, the other says fat will kill you.
One says to cut back on carbohydrates, the other says carbs are the only way to go.
We thought we'd take a look at five of the most popular diets (not the craziest ones -- you won't read about colonics and blood types here), take a look at who is doing them and what the experts think.
Although all these diets vary in ways great and small, it's worth noting that they all stress the importance of exercise, so no tossing out the exercise bike with the doughnuts.
Dr.Adam Drewnowski, director of nutritional sciences at the University of Washington, and registered dietician Kathleen Mahan, author and personal nutritionist at Seattle's Nutrition By Design, weigh in on a handful of the most popular diets.
But they're willing to indulge us here.
``The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet''by Dr.Rachael F. Heller and Dr.Richard F.Heller
(Signet, 322 pages, $7.99)
Who's doing it: Oprah Winfrey.
Promises, promises: Weight loss, fewer mood swings and more energy.
The scoop: That some overweight people release too much insulin after eating high-carb meals.
This increases the appetite, resulting in overeating.
The idea is to eat fewer carbs at two meals and have one ``reward'' meal each day.
What is this world coming to?
Furthermore, there's no snacking at all between meals.
And you have to eat your reward meal within one hour (so no splitting up that bowl of popcorn!)
Perfect for you if: You want to have your (flourless) cake and eat it too -- during your 60-minute reward meal window.
Expert opinion: Drewnowski -- First off, he said there's no way you can talk people into using up their reward meal with broccoli and such.
``Number one, the glycemic index of bread and boiled carrots is higher than a Snickers bar,'' said Drewnowski, explaining that the fat in the Snickers bar lowers its glycemic index.
``Number two, if you eat a whole meal and everything gets all mixed up ..the glycemic index of the whole meal will not equal the sum of its parts.''
In other words, it's impossible for the average person to calculate the glycemic index of a meal.
And anyway, Drewnowski said there's no scientificexplanation for why high insulin levels would cause us to crave specific types of carbohydrates.
Even so, there's something to this idea of carbohydrate addiction.
``Sugar/fat mixtures, yes, these are the foods that lots of people have trouble with, interestingly enough, mostly women,'' Drewnowski said.
Chocolate, cake and ice cream always show up on the list of foods women crave.
And while chocolate does show up on the list of male cravings, they generally struggle more with protein, salt and fat mixtures -- hamburgers, pizza, meatloaf, that sort of thing.
Ice cream also shows on the men's list.
Male and female rats indicate similar preferences, so don't go blaming societal gender roles for this stuff.
``The advantage of it is that it doesn't take things away from people.
In other words, they know they can have their carbohydrates during a certain period of time in a day,'' said Mahan.
``The disadvantage is that I think with eating all the carbs in a short period of time, your body is going to have to release a lot insulin to deal with it.''
``Eat More, Weigh Less''by Dr.Dean Ornish
(Quill, 448 pages, $15)
Who's doing it:
Well, no one famous has made a point of endorsing it, but the Swedish Medical Center's Heart Institute offers a Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease.
Promises, promises: Ornish says a vegetarian (or near vegetarian) diet low in fats and high in complex carbs can reverse prostate cancer, shrink tumors and help maintain a healthy weight.
The scoop: Ornish doesn't see his diet as one of deprivation -- he touts complex carbohydrates, beans and legumes, fruits and vegetables.
Fats (nuts, seeds, meats, oils) are out, as are dairy products, eggs, sugars, honey, white flour, salt, white rice and alcohol.
Even non-fat dairy products and low-fat processed foods are to be eaten in moderation.
You are encouraged to meditate.
The poop: One gin martini with a couple of olives and you've blown the whole thing!
Perfect for you if: You derive sustenance from your own self-righteousness.
Expert opinion: Drewnowski -- ``I think it's lucky that Dean Ornish combines his diet with meditation and prayer because that will help -- it's not a very tasty diet.''
That said, he adds that ``over-fed males of 50'' with high cholesterol levels and other cardiac issues will benefit from Ornish's diet.
``This is a clinical intervention type diet which is fine if you are a cardiac patient ...but it's not nutritionally balanced for a growing adolescent, a pregnant woman or a healthy, active adult.''
Mahan -- ``The problem with that diet is that it's so restrictive in fat that it causes you to restrict even good fats,'' says Mahan.
``Not only is fat essential in the body, but the fats available in olive oil and avocados and nuts are good for you.
You need more than 10 percent of fat in your diet -- not saturated fat, but the good fats.''
``He's talking more about healing the heart and the spiritual aspects of heart disease, not just the physical disease,'' says Mahan, adding that Ornish's diet, in general, is ``the one approach that's actually been shown to reverse plaque buildup in the arteries.''
``The Macrobiotic Way''by Michio Kushi
(Avery, 251 pages, $12.95)
Who's doing it: Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow and ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.
Promises, promises: High in fiber, the diet is supposed to prevent colon cancer.
The scoop: The macrobiotic diet is based on eating whole foods (as opposed to processed foods, heavy on preservatives and additives), organic grains as well as leafy, root, ground and sea vegetables.
Kushi recommends a diet of 50 to 60 percent whole cereal grains, 5 to 10 percent soups, 20 to 30 percent vegetables and 5 to 10 percent beans and sea vegetables (a variety of seaweed).
The poop: The no-no list is long: No dairy, red meat, poultry, cane or beet sugar, salmon, mackerel, tuna, swordfish, ginseng, commercial soy sauces and salt, mayonnaise, cashews, Brazil nuts, avocados, dates, figs, lemons, limes, oranges, mangoes, pineapple, hard liquor, wine, black tea, coffee, soda, tap water ...plus there are specific ways to cook everything -- pressure-cooking, picking and water-saute9ing among them.
Perfect for you if: You have a personal chef or have nothing better to do than fret over your next meal.
On a more serious level, Drewnowski worried that someone on this diet is looking for something more than a nutritionally balanced diet.
``To some extent, this is not a diet, this is a monastic way of life.
The people who adopt this don't do it for nutrition purposes, but for psychological reasons.
They need the discipline to get on with their life,'' said Drewnowski, adding that seeking this sort of diet might be a symptom of an eating disorder.
``Diana Vreeland said that elegance is refusal ...the macrobiotic diet is basically about refusal.''
But the diet does have its drawbacks.
Even then, I'm not sure you could get enough.''
``Enter the Zone''by Barry Sears
(Harper Collins, 328 pages, $25).
Who's doing it: Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Rene9e Zellweger, Sandra Bullock ...the list goes on and on.
Promises, promises: Lose weight, live longer, be fertile and pain free!
The scoop: Eat a diet consisting of 40 percent carbohydrates (veggies, not bread and pasta), 30 percent fat (the good stuff, like olive oil) and 30 percent protein (lean meats and fish) at every meal.
Eat up to six meals a day rather than gorging on larger portions.
The poop: The only grain allowed is slow-cooked oatmeal (say goodbye to bread, breadsticks and breadcrumbs).
But compared to the macrobiotic diet, the Zone is wild and crazy in terms of what it allows you to eat.
Perfect for you if: You have time to plan your meals well ahead of time or are rich enough to have Zone meals delivered to you.
(A local company called ZoneSeattle has been doing just that since August.
For more information: 206-236-9663, 1-866-317-9663 or www.the-zone-diet.com.)
Combining carbs, proteins and fats like the Zone causes a ``lower and slower release of insulin,'' which she says causes less fat depositing and more fat burning.
The Zone is also good because ``it forces people to look at the protein content in their diet -- and most people eat way too many carbs.''
Adding a little fat to every meal balances out the meal, keeping us satisfied longer because fat stays in the stomach the longest.
But, she cautioned that you can still go wrong.
``One of the problems is that you can still get too many calories -- it's not just proportion but portion control.''
``It's a very doable diet, but you cut out the cheap beans and grains, and your frisee lettuce and your arugula cost more,'' he said, adding that this is basically a diet for the upper-middle class.
``But there's nothing wrong with it, nutritionally.''
``Dr.Atkins' New Diet Revolution''
Dr.Robert C.Atkins
(Harper Collins, 540 pages, $13.95)
Who's doing it: Dennis Franz, Al Gore, Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Promises, promises: Lose weight, burn fat, reverse Type II diabetes, and never feel hungry or deprived.
The scoop: Developed by Atkins in 1972, the diet gives you license to eat cheese, meat, eggs and, well, mostly cheese, meat and eggs.
Atkins maintains that consuming sugars and other carbohydrates inhibits the body from burning fat.
By depriving your body of carbs, you force it into ketosis -- the burning of stored fat.
And the diet is high in animal fat, which can be tough on the kidneys.
Speaking of animals, and their fat, this diet is not doable for vegetarians.
But most importantly, ask yourself: Is life without pain au chocolat worth living?
Perfect for you if: You were a Tyrannosaurus rex in a past life and have little use for vegetables.
Expert opinion: Drewnowski -- ``He exaggerates the amount of fat that you can eat,'' said Drewnowski, pointing out that the Atkins diet includes about five time the amount of cholesterol recommended for a healthy diet.
``It has the potential to increase your cholesterol, but if you lose weight, your cholesterol could drop, so it could balance out.
At what point things balance out, I don't know.
There's not enough research on that,'' said Drewnowski, adding that whether you're talking about fats, proteins or carbs, at the end of the day, it's the calories that matter.
``The idea is that this works through reducing caloric intake through eating nothing but proteins and fat,'' he said, referring to the fact that proteins and fats are more filling than most carbohydrates.
``It's not what you eat, it's how much you eat.''
However, adding carbs to proteins generally makes them taste better, leading us to eat more of them.
``Bitter chocolate is fat -- there's no sugar, so when you eat bitter chocolate, you're eating fat, not sugar and you don't eat so much.
But the second you add sugar to it, you can eat it like bread.''
Mahan -- ``People do lose weight on it, and a recent study has shown that people's cholesterol doesn't go up.''
She added that the diet is good because it makes people focus on the amount of protein in their diet, but ultimately, she would recommend that Atkins followers focus on lean proteins rather than steaks and full-fat cheeses.
``The fact is that people eat high-fat pork rinds -- they sell them in nine different flavors -- and the reason is the Atkins diet, because they are carbohydrate free!''
Putting the squeeze on diet scams
Did you know you can ``lose from two to five pounds a week eating yummy Peanut Butter Snacks?''
Have you heard about the brand new, revolutionary natural energy tablet that lets you ``Eat All Day and Melt Away?''
Did you see the guy who went from looking like Gerard Depardieu to Arnold Schwarzenegger in 65 days?
And what about that diet that is ``chemically and enzyme balanced'' to help you lose 10 pounds in three days?
These claims and hundreds of others like them are included in Internet advertisements, and Becky Merk, a dietitian at Miami Valley Hospital, has probably heard of most of them.
She teaches a 12-week weight-control course for Miami Valley employees, and participants in the course have tried just about every supposed miracle body reformation scheme ever offered.
``Slim Fast.
LA Weight Loss.
The Hollywood Diet.
Sugar Busters.
The Zone.
The Atkins Diet.
People tell me they've tried all of them,'' Merk said.
``A lot of people are making a lot of promises about weight loss, but even if you manage to lose weight with one of these programs, it's very hard to maintain your new weight without making some basic lifestyle changes.''
Television, magazines, newspapers, billboards and the Internet are teeming with come-ons for weight-loss systems that promise dramatic results with little effort.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, which tries to enforce restrictions on fraudulent diet product claims, about 50 million Americans will go on a diet to lose weight this year.
Of those 50 million only about 2.5 million will succeed in losing weight and keeping it off.
And the fact that so many people keep paying billions of hard-earned dollars for special foods, supplements, books, equipment and seminars that don't work shows how desperate and gullible people can be, says author and fitness advocate Stephen Grisanti.
``Unfortunately, it's no different than the Lotto.
People want to get rich quick and easy, but how many people do you know who have won the Lotto?
They want to lose weight quick and easy, too.
That's not the way it works, though.''
Grisanti last year wrote ``Industry of Illusions: Health &amp; Fitness Industry Scams, Frauds, Fakes and Personal Trainers Exposed.''
Grisanti said his father was a martial arts expert and amateur boxing coach, so he became interested in physical fitness young and maintained his interest through adulthood.
``The people who need the most help are the ones getting scammed,'' Grisanti said.
``You see a lot of products advertising that they are `scientifically tested' or `medically proven.
' It's not science.
What it is is science fiction.''
Merk said the truth is that the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you consume.
That means exercising more and eating less.
Miami Valley Hospital has a wellness center with exercise equipment for its employees, and Merk teaches a 12-week weight reduction course that focuses on eating a healthy, balanced diet, exercising and modifying the behaviors that lead to overeating or inactivity.
She said most diet advertising talks about quick weight loss but says little or nothing about the more important issue of long-term weight management.
``What you lose is likely to be mostly water weight, and you're going to quickly gain that back.''
Merk said the first step in starting a weight-loss program should be a consultation with your doctor, not buying something based on an advertisement.
Some people think herbal products are safe because they're supposedly natural, but Merk said herbal products often contain active ingredients that can be harmful or that can interact badly with other medications.
``Also herbal products aren't regulated by the (Food and Drug Administration).
``You should be getting your nutrients from the foods you eat anyway, not from supplements.''
Melinda Abney, who completed Miami Valley's weight management course last year, said she had tried just about every type of diet available at one time or another, but none of them worked for long.
``You may be able to say, `I'm never going to eat bread again,' but how realistic is that?'' Abney said.
``I was on a diet once where you had to fast on Wednesdays.
I don't know what was special about Wednesday, but that was the day you didn't eat.
``Any of those diets were fine as long as you could keep them up, but they all got boring after a while.
When you're an old married woman with kids and a real life, you can't spend all your time thinking about a diet.
And as soon as I stopped following the diet, all the weight would come back.''
Abney, who works for the Miami Valley human resources department, said she has been dieting since high school with little lasting success.
She was able to lose 10 pounds last year after taking the hospital's weight management course and hasn't gained the weight back.
In addition to watching what she eats, Abney now exercises regularly, including mid-morning treadmill walks at the wellness center.
``One of my activities is going out Rollerblading with my kids,'' she said.
``I don't think of it as exercise.
I'm taking time to get out and play.''

Helpful hints from the FTC
The agency suggests that before you spend money on products or programs that promise fast or easy weight loss, weigh the claims and consider these tips:
``Lose 30 Pounds in Just 30 Days.
'' As a rule, the faster you lose weight, the more likely you are to gain it back.
Also, fast weight loss could harm your health.
Unless your doctor advises it, don't look for programs that promise quick weight loss.
``Lose All the Weight You Can for Just $39.99.'' Some weight-loss programs have hidden costs.
For example, some don't advertise the fact that you must buy their prepackaged meals that cost more than the program fees.
Before you sign up for any weight-loss program, ask for all the costs.
Get them in writing.
``Lose Weight While You Sleep.''
Claims for diet products and programs that promise weight loss without effort are phony.
``Lose Weight and Keep It Off for Good.
'' Be suspicious about products promising long-term or permanent weight loss.
To lose weight and keep it off, you must change how you eat and how much you exercise.
``John Doe Lost 84 Pounds in Six Weeks.''
Don't be misled by someone else's weight-loss claims.
Even if the claims are true, someone else's success may have little relation to your own chances of success.
``Scientific Breakthrough ...Medical Miracle.''
There are no miracle weight-loss products.
To lose weight, you must reduce your intake of calories and increase your physical activity.
Be skeptical about exaggerated claims.

DIETS BY THE DOZEN
Diets were first documented about 170 years ago, but who knows?
Maybe Eve was eating fruit because she wanted to look good in her fig leaf.
Folklore has it that in 1087, William the Conqueror discovered that he was too fat to ride his horse, so he climbed in bed and went on a liquid diet.
His liquid of choice was alcohol, but if the tale is true, it may be the first known instance of someone changing his food intake to lose weight.
Because William died from injuries suffered during a riding accident, one can speculate that he was successful in dropping enough bulk to mount his horse again.
As humans became more knowledgeable about producing and storing food, they indulged themselves.
The industrial revolution contributed to more food on our plates and more circumference to our waistlines.
Eventually, people started looking for ways to take the pounds back off, and diets have been in fashion ever since.
It's estimated that Americans will spend $40 billion on diets this year, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.
"They are not realistic because they are so hard to stick to," she said.
"Most are not meant to be followed for life, so most people gain the weight back when they quit them.
"There is no easy way out of being overweight," she said.
"It still comes down to following the Food (Guide) Pyramid guidelines, proper portion control and regular exercise three to four times a week."
The evolution of trend diets in American history has picked on just about every food group and even, in some cases, a specific food.
Here's a brief look at a few of the more noteworthy diets.
The first documented diet in the United States was the bland diet, advocated by Presbyterian minister Sylvester Graham in the 1830s.
His diet consisted of coarse-ground whole wheat flour baked into flat bread, which became known as graham crackers.
The low-carb diet craze of recent years isn't as new as people might think.
In the late 1850s, an English casket maker named William Banting found that he was so overweight he could no longer tie his own shoes or navigate stairs.
Fed up, so to speak, he developed the first documented low-carb plan, published as "Letter of Corpulence," in 1862 after losing 50 pounds in a year's time on a diet of lean meat, dry toast, eggs, green vegetables and unsweetened fruit.
The theory behind "Fletcherizing" was that chewing food until it was liquid resulted in less overeating and improved digestion and nutrient absorption.
Some accounts hold that novelist Henry James and oil baron John D. Rockefeller were Fletcherizers.
Counting calories came along in the 1920s, and the 1950s saw the birth of the diet pill Dexedrine.
The stimulant is no longer prescribed because of harmful side effects.
The most fruitful plan of the 1960s was Weight Watchers, established by Jean Nidetch using a diet plan devised by Dr.Norman Jollife of the New York City Department of Public Health.
By the end of that decade, the group had grossed $8 million.
Today it's a $1 billion a year business with the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, its leading spokesperson.
The early 1970s saw vegetarianism launched, followed closely by publication of "The Diet Revolution" by Dr.Robert Atkins.
His low-carb diet book raised skeptical eyebrows in the medical community.
Twenty years later he tried again with "The New Diet Revolution," published in 1994, and the idea caught on like wildfire.
The book sold 10 million copies and remains one of the top-50 best-selling books of all time.
The craze led to Atkins food products and special Atkins sections on many current restaurant menus.
Critics maintain that long-term effects of the diet include heart and kidney problems.
The '80s gave us Jenny Craig, and the '90s brought Slim-Fast shakes, the Zone Diet and Sugar Busters.
In 2003, The South Beach Diet tweaked the already prevalent low-carb diets.
The low-carb craze seems to be fading, however, according to a survey by New York market research firm NPD Group.
NPD found that the number of low-carbonistas peeked in March 2004, when 9 percent of Americans were following the popular diets.
By September, the number had dropped to 4.6 percent.
So, what might be next on the minds of waist-watching Americans?
The early favorite seems to be The Satiety Diet, according to a December 2004 report by the online health site WebMD.
The diet consists of eating more of the foods that make you feel full but don't make you fat and is also called "volumetrics" in the report.
The plan also recommends dishes rich in water content, such as soups, stews and casseroles but, unlike many diets, does not exclude any specific foods.
"They don't teach healthy eating habits and are usually not nutritionally balanced."

The ``somebody spiked my drink'' dodge is passe among doped athletes in the Ripped Fuel era.
Now, it's ``I didn't know it was loaded.''
Loaded with steroids, ephedrine, caffeine, whatever.
When US bobsledder Pavle Jovanovic tested positive for norandrostenedione and got thrown off the Olympic team last week, he said it was because he unwittingly took a dietary supplement that contained steroids.
Latvian driver Sandis Prusis made the same claim when he lit up the board in November, but the international bobsled federation bought it and gave Prusis a three-month retroactive ban that allows him to compete in the Games.
But even if Jovanovic can wangle the same deal, he'll still miss the Games, since he tested positive at the December team trials.
And driver Todd Hays, who was counting on Jovanovic for both his two-man and four-man sleds, might miss out on the medal that would end the Americans' 46-year dry spell at Olympus.
Last fall, the International Olympic Committee warned all athletes to avoid supplements, because many of them contain banned substances.
The US Anti-Doping Agency said the same thing, advising athletes not even to take multivitamins.
If athletes have any doubt, they're supposed to bring the supplement to their federation for testing.
They've been told that for years.
But some, like Jovanovic, either don't listen or don't care.
And their teammates pay the price.
Hays, who had a shot to make the podium in both events, is in limbo.
Jovanovic technically is still on the team, pending his appeal hearing this week.
So does Hays still train with him, or with substitute Garrett Hines?
Hays, not Jovanovic, is the victim here.
He skipped the final two World Cup races _ and likely forfeited the six-figure overall champion's bonus _ to get ready for the Games.
Even if he hadn't, Hays would have lost out.
Jovanovic's ban also cost Hays one of his Cup victories.
Meanwhile, IOC president Jacques Rogge expects up to 10 positive tests at Salt Lake, which would be twice as many as all of the previous Winter Games combined.
``I'd much prefer there were none,'' Rogge said, ``but we don't want to let anyone get away with it.''
Will the Boys of Winter get to ignite the cauldron at Friday night's opening ceremonies?
Nobody's saying, but the 1980 US men's hockey team, garbed in game jerseys, will be introduced on the floor of the stadium during the festivities.
And after that?
Only chief organizer Mitt Romney and a handful of others know for sure.
The hottest rumor has been that captain Mike Eruzione and Soviet counterpart Boris Mikhailov will light the candle together.
So determined are the organizers to keep the final torchbearer(s) secret that they've been circulating fake confidential memos with different names . . .
The White House won't confirm it until Wednesday, but President Bush is all but certain to formally open the Games.
If he does, Bush will be the first chief US executive to do the honors at the Winter Games.
Herbert Hoover (1932), Dwight Eisenhower (1960), and Jimmy Carter (1980) all declined . . .
After two months of meandering, the Olympic torch relay finally reaches Utah Monday at sunrise for the final 1,050-mile trek through 50 cities and towns.
Among the modes of transportation: plane, boat, bicycle, stagecoach, horse, skis, and snowshoes.
The torch will arrive in Salt Lake Thursday afternoon . . .
One thing Rogge won't do at Salt Lake's closing ceremonies is declare these Games ``the best ever.''
``I won't do that,'' said Rogge.
``I'll give the opinion of the IOC on the Games, but I will not compare to the other Games.
Also unlike Samaranch, Rogge still plans on living in the athletes' village instead of the usual hotel suite downtown.
The Salt Lake bidders weren't lying when they promised the Lords of the Rings that they'd have snow aplenty for the Games.
Another storm is expected to blow through town the morning of the opening ceremonies . . .
Deadline for bidding for the 2010 Winter Games comes Monday, with at least seven cities expected to be in the scramble: favored Vancouver (British Columbia, Canada), Sarajevo (Bosnia), Bern (Switzerland), Salzberg (Austria), Harbin (China), Jaca (Spain), and Kangwon province (South Korea).
The IOC will choose the winner next year.
What's Jean Racine's side of the US women's bobsled dust-up?
That she offered brakeman/best friend Jen Davidson a chance at a pushoff after she'd dumped her, and that Davidson said nix.
``The day I decided to put Gea (Johnson) in my sled, I offered Jen a chance to push off,'' said Racine, ``and she wouldn't hear of it.''
Racine, stung at being tagged ``Mean Jean'' by critics who called her cold-blooded, says she was just trying to field a gold-medal sled.
``How could I put my best friend on the team,'' she said, ``when she just wasn't pushing well?'' . . .
The US women's ice hockey team pitched a shutout during its four-month exhibition tour, going 31-0 with 22 victories against Games rivals.
The Americans were 8-0 vs.world champion Canada (with a 31-13 goal aggregate), 6-0 vs.China (69-5), 4-0 vs.Sweden (40-3), 3-0 vs.Russia (26-1), and 1-0 vs.Germany (7-1).
They'll open Olympic play with the Germans a week from Tuesday, then face the Chinese and Finns.
Canada, Russia, Sweden, and Kazakhstan are in the other group . . .
Looks like the Olympic ice dancing will be the most competitive in years.
Italy's Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio, beaten by Canada's Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz at the Grand Prix final, were knocked off again by France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat in the European championships . . .
Now that she's raised eyebrows by making the Olympic figure skating team, Sasha Cohen wants to make jaws drop in Salt Lake by becoming the first woman to land a quadruple jump.
``I'm always looking for ways to push anything I do,'' said the 17-year-old Cohen, who has tried the quad salchow several times in competition.
``It would be amazing to be able to make history in figure skating.''
If Cohen lands the quad, it'll be the biggest breakthrough in women's skating since Japan's Midori Ito landed the triple axel in 1989 . . .
Mixed results for the US skaters at the recent Four Continents championships in Seoul.
Jennifer Kirk of Newton and dancers Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won titles, but the men didn't make the podium, and Stephanie Kalesavich and Aaron Parchem were fifth in pairs.
Based on this year's World Cup results, Germany's lugers figure to clean up once again at the Games.
They finished 1-2-3 in the women's standings (Silke Kraushaar-Sylke Otto-Barbara Niedernhuber), 1-2 in men's doubles (Patric Leitner-Alexander Resch and Steffen Skel-Steffen Woeller), and third in men's (Georg Hackl).
Though the Americans came on strong in last weekend's Cup finale in Germany (silvers by Tony Benshoof and Chris Thorpe-Clay Ives in doubles), they don't rank in the top three in any category . . .
Not that the average age of Olympic athletes is getting younger, but for the first time in history, there will be an orthodontist on duty at the village polyclinic, just in case a band snaps . . .
Tonya Harding's latest tale of woe:
She and roommate/manager Linda Lewis were evicted from their Washington ranch house by a county judge last week for nonpayment of more than $4,500 in rent.
SOME WINTER STARS PREFER NOT TO GO FOR THE GOLD
Tara Dakides sat comfortably behind the wheel of her Cadillac Escalade as it gulped down the paper-clip bends in the mountain roads before her earlier this week.
She was on her way to yet another snowboard event, and if she needed guidance, there was always the OnStar button.
Her internal compass has its limits, though:
It won't direct her to the Olympics.
As one of the best freestyle snowboarders in America, Dakides competes everywhere, but she will not journey to the Winter Games.
Who needs it?
For most athletes, winning an Olympic medal provides not only the payoff for years of training but also a one-shot chance to slip into a celebrity skin and parlay the moment into a financial gain.
``That's individualized.
If you let it, it will.''
As torn as some snowboarders are on the issue, there is an ambivalence toward extreme athletes from inside the Olympic structure, too.
Some purists recoil at marketing ploys and dismiss these sports as a fad, but leaders of several U.S. sports federations, including those in luge, bobsled and short-track speedskating, want to market the thrill-seeking danger of their sports in order to attract a new wave of athletes.
We just haven't positioned them that way, and we haven't connected with our youth that way.''
Olympians are customarily expected to fit a certain wholesome ideal.
But they were also the same officials who were desperate to introduce snowboarding at the 1998 Nagano Games after watching participation levels double while skiing lost ground.
Even though Olympics officials were embarrassed by the Canadian Ross Rebagliati's positive test for marijuana as a snowboard gold medalist in Nagano, they also recognized the need for tolerance in order to expand their reach.
Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, did not mention extreme sports by name, but in a speech to the opening session Sunday night, he alluded to the Olympics' need to remain relevant by attending to every generation.
(STORY CAN END HERE.
OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
The allure of an Olympic gold medal is different for these younger athletes.
Figure skaters like Michelle Kwan earn $3 million annually on Olympic build-up, and downhill skiers like Picabo Street also need a Winter Games moment to catapult their marketability.
Snowboarding blossomed independent of the Olympics, and so a resistance to the Olympic structure seemed inevitable.
Some snowboarders fancy themselves as outlaws fresh from a jailbreak.
Less than a decade ago, snowboarders were either forbidden on the slopes or were required to have a stamp on the hand to glide down a mountain.
There is something real about that.
I've also gotten to see where it's at now, see it evolve.''
On NBC, snowboarding is scheduled to air eight times during the Games, with four prime-time segments and four afternoon slots.
While producers want to resist turning the event into a music video and to avoid the use of snowboard slang _ such as referring to a good aerial as ``sick'' _ NBC executives are seeking the Mountain Dew demographics (ages 18 to 28) that ESPN has tapped into with the X Games.
They won out.
They don't fit the traditional Olympic mold.''
Beyond snowboarding, NBC has also cast lugers and bobsledders as extreme athletes, with a hard sell on speed and risk.
``One of the very important parts of our lead-up promotion is to remind younger adults that the Olympics have sports and athletes who are right up their alley, that some of the original extreme sports are not on some made-for-TV event, but are in the Olympics,'' Neal said.
But whether NBC can translate this approach into Winter Games ratings is up for debate.
Ron Simaio, ESPN's vice president for programming, who is managing director of the Global X Games, wonders if NBC will see an uptick in young adult viewers.
For years, aerialists and mogulers were the quintessential thrill-seekers as they twisted and flipped through the air like Cirque du Soleil stars on skis.
Jonny Moseley morphed into a movie star with the use of his trick skis.
Now, freestyle skiing is feeling the effects of snowboarding's popularity in the form of a reduced participation rate.
The U.S. snowboarding team would benefit from the gravitation of youths to their sport, if all the elite athletes had Olympic dreams.
In 1998, the U.S. snowboarders mustered just two bronze medals.
This year, there are crossover artists like J.J. Thomas, an X Games star, who will dot the American roster.
People want to compete, and the Olympics is a competition.''
The Olympic competition needs the extreme athletes, not just for the American viewers but for the worldwide audience.
Zaynab Behzadnia, director of public relations for the Familie, an action sports marketing agency, represents several extreme stars who have turned what were once cult sports into a global business.
Behzadnia noted that the X Games (the annual winter version was just staged in Aspen, Colo.) are the Olympics to many extreme athletes.
But he said the buzz did not fizzle after the closing ceremony as with the Olympics.
With the Gravity Games, X Games and dozens of other competitions, the money from sponsors keeps rolling in, much to the amazement of the athletes.
Most hope it settles down into a more civilized dialogue.
``I read a lot about X Games athletes and how they diss the Olympics and stuff like that,'' said Jeremy Bloom, the top moguler on the U.S. Olympic freestyle skiing team.
The Olympic athletes also do, too, so I don't think there has to be trash-talking on either side.''
She laughs when she mentions the word career, but Dakides has had to make serious business decisions.
Suddenly, she is able to buy her mother a new television set, keep her father in some very hip clothes and make appointments with real estate agents.
Dakides has a home near Mammoth Lakes, Calif., and a condominium, too, plus a sports utility vehicle the size of a Manhattan apartment.
``It's amazing,'' Dakides said.
You know, after that, what else do you want?''
Some would say an Olympic gold medal.
For many athletes, that is the cherished top prize of their sport.
FROM SECURITY TO SHARED GOLD, THESE WINTER OLYMPICS WERE
An embarrassing bidding scandal, sluggish ticket sales and the specter of terrorism fed a sense of foreboding about the games.
The anxiety seemed to mock a handmade sign hanging two weeks ago outside a house 40 miles from here in the tiny town of Mountain Green: ``Welcome Olympics, Feel at Home.''
By the end of the two weeks that followed, Americans were feeling more at home than ever at a Winter Olympics, relishing their mastery in new-age sports that spawned a record haul of 30 medals through Friday's events, broadened interest in the Winter Games and boosted television ratings by nearly 20 percent.
There was also a pervasive sense of satisfaction over a smooth logistical success amid unprecedented security.
But not everyone felt at home, or wanted, at the Salt Lake Games.
What began in splendor and spiritual unity at the opening ceremony on Feb. 8 is ending with charges of a North American bias wrapped in a vehement anti-American fervor.
The breakdown of collegiality began three days into the games, when the Canadian figure skating pairs team of David Pelletier and Jamie Sale were denied a gold medal victory that many people thought they had earned.
On nearly every day since, the Olympics proceeded on dual tracks: one following the riveting, uplifting competition, the other pursuing a burgeoning backlash and undercurrent of finger-pointing.
These were the fun Olympics, the safe Olympics, the largely compact Olympics, the demographically blessed Olympics and the telegenic Olympics.
In keeping with the rogue spirit of the newer sports of skeleton, snowboarding and short-track skating, there was a rakish appeal to these Olympics from the moment the Americans marched into the opening ceremony in berets and hip, baby-blue vests.
These were also the sour-grapes Olympics.
No result seemed official until the post-event hearing was completed.
As the games unfolded, the figure skating pairs decision appears to have opened the door for aggrieved national federations to protest any ruling they considered unjust.
For most Americans, however, these were the Winter Games that worked.
Launched in the wake of the bidding scandal and with the burden accompanying a record budget of nearly $2 billion, the Salt Lake Games did seem to find a home in the hills and valleys of Utah.
Picabo Street, the American skier who went through an extensive rehab of a badly injured knee just to compete in the games, said: ``The last four years for me have been about that one moment coming into the finish when I heard the Americans roar and saw kids' faces painted red, white and blue.
While the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, have long been credited with reviving interest in the modern Winter Games by capturing the essence of winter climate sports with an ancient setting and simple Nordic charm, the Salt Lake Games captured a Winter Olympics popularly marching into a new century.
At a time when many wondered if the Olympics could endure or remain relevant in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks last September _ when many of its sports were deemed outdated, with its international leadership denigrated or ignored, and with old world alliances threatening its credibility _ the 2002 Olympics instead broke ground, altering the way the games are perceived.
The Salt Lake Games had drama and pathos and were executed with a certain folksiness, but their real success may be the path left for the Olympic movement.
As the most costly Olympics in history, and the first to impose vast security measures that will very likely now become routine and further increase Olympic budgets, the Salt Lake Games may also have demonstrated how difficult it will be for the International Olympic Committee to bring the Olympics to Africa and South America, as it would like to do.
Ultimately, the Salt Lake Games conferred upon the Olympic movement an updated, modernized blueprint for how to run a novel Winter Games that was cozy, attractive to a younger audience, and with significance and sizzle.
Like virtually every Olympic Games, whether modern or ancient, it could not avoid quarrels, frequently with political and geographic resonance.
True to form, the winners were happier than the losers, and again, as in most Olympics, the home team won more medals than usual.
The 2006 Winter Games in Turin, Italy, will very likely benefit from a well-earned bounce from the Salt Lake Games.
If the Olympic movement was shaken by protests and the new ground underfoot, the games still proceeded, for the most part, as if at home in the uncomplicated and largely unadorned mountains and plains of Utah.
COMPETITIONS: IT'S NEW AGE VS.TRADITIONAL
The Salt Lake Games expanded the demographics of the television audience, but they also exposed a split in the Winter Olympics between the traditional sports, like the biathlon and ski jumping, and the new-age sports like moguls and snowboarding that appeal to younger fans.
In the future, the networks and the IOC will have to confront a competition quandary: how to balance tradition with all the wily, young Turks bucking it.
More specifically, how do Olympic officials ensure that Swiss ski-jumping legends, Norwegian gold-medal biathletes and champion Dutch speedskaters are not obscured by all those attention-grabbing snowboarders and short-track speedskaters.
On the surface, it was business as usual in Salt Lake City.
The Nordic nations _ Norway, Sweden and Finland _ won a combined 40 medals at the 1998 Games in Nagano and 35 medals in Lillehammer in 1994.
Through Friday, they had accumulated 35 medals, with Norway leading the way with 11 gold, seven silver and four bronze.
All but one of Norway's 22 medals came from traditional Nordic sports like Alpine skiing, biathlon and cross-country.
The Netherlands continued to be seen as a speedskating power.
All seven medals won by the Dutch entering the weekend came on the large oval.
With 33 medals, Germany led the overall medal count, as it did in Nagano, Japan, in 1998.
It had won nine medals in biathlon and dominated the bobsled and luge events entering the weekend.
Sylke Otto, the gold medalist in the women's luge singles, led three Germans to the podium during a sweep of the competition.
Yet the so-called extreme sports have not only lured younger viewers to the television set in hopes of catching a glimpse of their Generation X brethren catching air out of the halfpipe, they have also given American athletes a stranglehold on newfangled, made-for-TV winter sports.
Snowboarding, skeleton, moguls skiing, short-track speedskating and women's bobsled accounted for 12 of the 30 medals won by American athletes entering the weekend.
Whether it was the strains of the band Blink 182 ringing through Kelly Clark's minidisc headphones as she flew out of the halfpipe to win America's first gold medal at the 19th Winter Games or Apolo Ohno's body nearly perpendicular to the ice as Ohno, a goateed Seattle teen-ager, wove around the short-track oval, these were not your grandfather's Olympics.
Younger, hipper audiences who would not sit through a 30-kilometer cross-country skiing race were glued to television sets for Jim Shea's 51-second, headfirst joy ride on a rattling fiberglass sled in a driving snowstorm to win a gold in the skeleton.
Nowhere was the shift in the balance of power at the Winter Games more noticeable than the night when three Americans, Ross Powers, Danny Kass and J.J. Thomas, took the podium at the medals plaza downtown, having swept the men's snowboarding halfpipe.
Soon after, the Foo Fighters rocked the open-air theater, as snowboarders and their legions crowd-surfed through the night.
Soldier Hollow, the site of the cross-country skiing and biathlon competitions, was perhaps the least-crowded place over the past two weeks _ even though some of the games' most compelling stories took place there.
CONTROVERSY: SHARING THE GOLD, WITH THE PAIRS WILD
On the third night of Olympic competition, Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze were awarded the pairs gold medal in a split decision that plunged the games into controversy.
The uproar turned the Canadians, Sale and Pelletier, into talk-show guests for a North American audience that adored the pair, and it introduced the world to the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who had impeccable credentials, and who first admitted and then retracted statements acknowledging pressure she felt to favor the Russians.
Under an intense public outcry, skating officials rushed to douse the firestorm by suspending Le Gougne and inventing a loophole that would allow them to give a duplicate gold to Canada's popular pair, even though the investigation was far from over.
The allegations spun out of control for days.
In an attempt to prop up figure skating _ which had already been besieged by ice-dance judging scandals in the past _ the president of the International Skating Union, Ottavio Cinquanta, proposed a scoring system that abolished the magical 6.0 perfect score.
In June, the skating union is expected to vote on the new scoring method, which would use the marks from seven of 14 judges, selected at random by computer, to determine the final total for a skater.
Many questions about the system are yet to be worked out, and whether the proposal will be approved by the tradition-bound skating union is uncertain at best.
In April, the ISU council is expected to hear the evidence involving the judging scandal surrounding Le Gougne and to make a decision about who is telling the truth.
As long as humans are judging a subjective sport, controversy will loom.
That's part of the beauty of figure skating.
TELEVISION: NBC DOES ITS SHARE OF WINNING, TOO
To televise the Salt Lake Games, NBC reinvented its staid Olympic formula.
It integrated live and taped events to invigorate the tempo; it showed fewer and shorter athletic profiles that shed the weepy motif of many features in Olympics past; and it appealed directly to young viewers by producing sports like snowboarding and aerials as if they were in ESPN's hip, rambunctious X Games, not Baron Pierre de Coubertin's Olympics.
NBC crafted its Salt Lake City production template from what went wrong at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, where ratings fell far below the network's guarantees to advertisers.
But even before NBC rewrote its playbook, it had three advantages that CBS had lacked at the 1998 Nagano Games: a domestic location, a strong American team and a traditional Olympic month to show the Olympics, unlike back-to-school and back-from-vacation September when the Sydney Games took place.
The result: Through the first 14 days, NBC's prime-time Nielsen rating soared to a 19.
3, 18 percent better than CBS' rating four years ago at Nagano.
By the end of the games, more than 180 million people _ individuals who watched at least six minutes once during the Olympics _ will have tuned in.
NBC will make an estimated $75 million profit.
But the lessons learned in Salt Lake City may not be easily applied to the next three Olympics: the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece, the 2006 Winter Games in Turin and the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing.
Yes, NBC can continue with fewer profiles and can still promote and produce with viewers 18 to 34 years old uppermost in its mind.
And it will no doubt add to a technical arsenal that included replays superimposing two skiers racing each other on a slalom course.
Each of the next three Olympic host cities is at least six time zones from New York, however, meaning that NBC will probably revert to heavily taped productions in prime time, as it did in Sydney.
Beijing is 13 time zones away, creating the same potential problems NBC faced in Sydney, when it showed taped programming long after the results were known.
In Athens, NBC is thinking about carrying live events on MSNBC from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, and an afternoon program with live coverage on NBC.
``But the majority of track and field, swimming and gymnastics will be on tape in prime time,'' Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, said.
The Summer Olympics have more events than their winter counterpart, and require more time on NBC.
Yet NBC has learned that broadcasting for three-and-a-half hours in prime time (sometimes four) keeps more viewers watching for longer periods of time than did its five-hour broadcasts from Sydney.
Ebersol said that the lessons from Salt Lake City about the pacing of a prime-time telecast _ with more events and fewer features _ can be employed in a somewhat longer Summer Olympics production.
``We can get more on the air if we do less,'' he said.
FRESH FACES: WHO WILL FORGET SALE AND PELLETIER?
The fresh faces of Sale and Pelletier beamed from cereal boxes in Canada even before the controversy over the pairs skating competition made them the sport's most recognized faces.
But the cries of unfairness that followed their silver medal and eventually won them their own gold medal catapulted them into an international spotlight.
They were among many new faces to emerge from the Salt Lake Games, athletes who got boosted from relative anonymity to international prominence.
Sarah Hughes won a sure sweetheart's place in the heart of a nation when she rose from fourth in the skating short program to first after moving flawlessly through a challenging long program.
This was supposed to be Michelle Kwan's moment, after she had lost four years ago in Nagano to Tara Lipinski.
In aerials, Alisa Camplin of Australia flipped her way to win a gold medal, even though she had never won a major event before.
Jill Bakken and Vonetta Flowers, an American bobsled duo, also made an unexpected appearance in the lineup of smiling gold medalists.
Flowers took up the sport only after failing to make the American track and field team for the Sydney Games, and she had been dumped as brakewoman for another bobsledding pair last fall.
She became the first African-American to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.
In another first for an increasingly diverse country, the speedskater Derek Parra became the first Mexican-American to win a medal in the Winter Olympics.
If Ohno, his U.S. Olympic teammate, was the bad-boy teen-ager of the games, Parra came off as the good guy, a new father who worked at Home Depot to support himself while training.
Jim Shea Jr.was a first of a different kind: the first third-generation Olympian, whose father and grandfather had both competed in the Winter Olympics.
The youngest Shea, a skeleton competitor, was popular before the games, having been chosen by his fellow American athletes to say the athletes' oath at the opening ceremony, just as his grandfather had done in 1932.
But Shea had not been expected to even medal.
He placed a photograph of his grandfather, who was killed by a drunken driver last month, in his helmet before taking off down the mountain.
When he arrived at the bottom, he was in first place, having won the gold, as his grandfather had done in speed-skating.
SECURITY: ORGANIZERS' MOTTO IS SAFETY FIRST
Years of intense planning, enhancements after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the use of 15,000 law enforcement and military personnel so far are keeping the Olympics as safe as federal officials predicted they would be.
From the beginning, the Bush administration made security at the games a priority, underscoring it in the weeks before the opening with visits to Salt Lake City by Attorney General John Ashcroft and Tom Ridge, the director of Homeland Security.
President Bush attended the opening ceremonies, and Vice President Dick Cheney was scheduled to attend the closing ceremony on Sunday.
The huge federal investment in security _ $400 million _ reflected the enormous challenge of safeguarding the 900 square miles of northern Utah in which the Olympics took place.
It resulted in a massive showing of police and military presence, with checkpoints and magnetometers at the mouth of almost any place an Olympic athlete, official or spectator might visit, including competition sites, downtown hotels, even public plazas for nightly entertainment.
In all, 60 local, state and federal law enforcement agencies have been involved in the security effort, all of them linked for the first time at a major international sports event in the United States through coordinated computer and communication programs.
The need for this type of extensive security arose from the aftermath of a bomb exploding at the 1996 Atlanta Games _ when law enforcement agencies had difficulty coordinating their response _ and then because of the threats and acts of terrorism against the United States, at home and abroad.
Going into the final weekend of the games, the authorities had only garden-variety problems requiring a response, including street protesters getting a little too rambunctious, a man trying to scale the fence of the athletes' quarters, dozens of bomb scares, at least one anthrax scare and about a dozen small planes wandering, unannounced, into Utah airspace.
Nothing much came of any of the problems, officials said.
But the greater relief was that none of the threats so feared after Sept. 11 had materialized thus far.
The security efforts were complemented by thousands of volunteers who kept lines moving, directed pedestrian traffic near competition sites and helped the authorities at the various checkpoints.
Early in the games, there were waits of 30 minutes and more to get through security and into athletic sites.
That, according to Robert Flowers, commander of the Utah Olympic Public Safety Command, was partly because of the diligence of volunteers at checkpoints who were eager to conduct a thorough search, as well as because of the forgetfulness of spectators, who sometimes failed to empty their pockets of potentially dangerous items.
But as the days passed, the system kicked in as planned, and few complained; it became increasingly evident that security was now as visible a part of the Olympics as the five Olympic rings.
TURIN 2006: FOR FUTURE REFERENCE, A NEW STARTING POINT
The two Olympics, they say, will be quite different.
``We cannot copy what they did in logistics,'' said Franco Frattini, Italy's minister of public function, who heads the Italian government's role in the Turin Games.
``But we have to find a path for the Italian Olympic Games.''
But Turin is clearly eager to adopt some of the innovations of Salt Lake City.
Organizers in Salt Lake City decided to award most medals not at the site of the competition, but at a downtown medals plaza.
Turin will have a similar nighttime ceremony, but not in a downtown parking lot transformed into Cinderella's two-week Olympic ball.
It will take place in Piazza Castello, the city's most famous square.
``We don't need to build a medals plaza,'' Valentino Castellani, president of Turin's organizing committee, said.
``History built it for us.''
There will be no new sports or events for the Turin Olympics, and the number of athletes is expected to remain stable at 2,500.
Unless technology intervenes, fewer speedskating records would be set in Turin.
The city is 800 feet above sea level, 4,000 feet below Salt Lake City.
For athletes, breathing easier will mean more air resistance and slower speeds.
Castellani said that after the terrorism attacks in New York and Washington, there had been concern in Italy about how much money could be raised for the Turin Games through sponsorships.
The Salt Lake Games' ability to combine tightened security with down-home friendliness also earned high marks.
``It's not easy to make people feel secure and relaxed at the same time,'' Castellani said.
``The situation we have faced here has been an emergency, and a little bit exceptional, not normal.''
Salt Lake takes home the gold
For many day and in many ways the XIX Winter Games glided along almost as smoothly as the world record-setting speedskaters at the Utah Olympic Oval.
At the United States' first Winter Olympics in 22 years, busses ran on time.
The unprecedented $400 million security effort worked.
The U.S. squad tapped new, diverse talent and was hotter than their blue Roots berets, the must-have fashion statement here.
Americans amassed more than twice as many medals as they'd won at any previous Winter Olympics, fueled in part by loud, proud and appreciative fans.
``The sound literally lifts you,'' U.S. speedskating gold medalist Chris Witty said.
``Generations will pass before we hear that sound again.''
Romney, squeaky clean head of the once scandal-racked Salt Lake Organizing Committee, had no idea how prophetic he would be.
Political squabbles and backbiting have lately marred a well-run $2 billion effort here.
As these Games conclude today, they may be fighting for an unofficial silver or even a bronze in world opinion.
These technically proficient Olympics, the first held in the U.S. since the the problem-scarred 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, have drawn low scores from Russia, South Korea and sometimes even Canada for the artlessness of officials for everything from figure skating to short track speedskating.
``North American athletes receive a clear advantage,'' Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed, while declaring these Games a ``flop.''
Not that such divisive episodes dampened the exuberance of the fans at the sold-out, flag-festooned venues that many spectators paid more than face value to attend.
``Luge, I've got luge!'' scalpers yelled on street corners here.
Rare was the sport _ major, minor or made-for-MTV _ that didn't have a compelling performance, story or controversy.
Some had all three.
Figure skating was NBC's television ratings star with Sarah Hughes' come-from-behind gold medal performance drawing the most Thursday-night viewers since Jerry Seinfeld's finale about an Olympiad ago.
At office water coolers from Texas to Moscow the hot topic was the dual gold medals awarded Canadian pair figure skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier and their Russian rivals, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze.
But there was so much more.
Speedskater Derek Parra became the first Mexican American to win a gold medal in the Winter Games; Vonetta Flowers the first black.
Steven Bradbury, after a NASCAR-style pileup, became the first Australian to go gold in the Winter Games, pulling his upset in the 1,000 meters short track speed skating.
Liver transplant recipient Chris Klug, an American, took a bronze in snowboarding.
The American hockey team hung on to beat the Russians 3-2 in Friday's semifinal, 22 years after Lake Placid's Miracle on Ice.
Today they'll play Canada in a much-anticipated shootout for the gold.
``Yaaaah! Gold medal!'' Switzerland's Simon Ammann summed up after the Harry Potter lookalike won the first of two surprise gold medals in ski jumping, floating on air longer than anyone else.
Sometimes the world's best winter athletes even offered wisdom.
U.S. skeleton gold medalist Jim Shea, a third generation Olympian, touched hearts by sliding down the hill with the funeral card of his recently deceased grandfather tucked in his helmet.
It's about the friendships.
It's about competing and the world coming together.''
Nyet!
It's all about the medals, winning, the Russian delegation all but screamed Thursday.
And that was before Hughes' bold long program ripped the gold from the grasp of Russian hopeful Irina Slutskaya and American Michelle Kwan.
While stopping short of asking for the return of Alaska, the Russian delegation here did inquire about a dual gold medal for Slutskaya.
They also pressed for a gold for the Russian women's cross-country relay team, which lost nine-time Olympic medalist and national heroine Larissa Lazutina for high levels of hemoglobin.
Can't we all just get along?
Oddly enough, the squabbling and backbiting may have erupted after almost two weeks here because larger problems didn't materialize.
Coming in and going out, security was the major issue of these Games.
As host to the world the U.S. threw almost quadruple the amount of money that was spent on the much larger 1996 Atlanta Games.
As many as 15,000 security personnel were here, almost six guards for every athlete.
The Games hoped for the best, but tried to prepare for the worst.
A 36-member National Response Team, standing by to handle the most serious biological and chemical disasters, sat happily idle.
Almost one dozen small planes were escorted by military jets out of the no-fly zone around events.
Unattended bags prompted bomb scares, which almost became routine, as about one dozen of those were also recorded.
Things that used to wind up in the lost and found, some lunch pails and a backpack, ended up being detonated.
While ever-present, the security stopped short of being heavy-handed or depressing to the Olympic spirit, the way some felt it was in Atlanta.
That was just one edge Salt Lake had on America's 1996 host.
``There were problems with transportation and the computer information systems in Atlanta,'' said Don Mischer, a University of Texas graduate responsible for producing the opening and closing ceremonies in Salt Lake and Atlanta.
``Excellency,'' as Samaranch liked to be called, ruled 21 years.
He liked to be treated as a head of state and some International Olympic Committee members got used to being bribed like corrupt politicians.
That's how the Salt Lake Games really began, with a scandal that would see 10 IOC members resign or be forced from their positions.
Romney was called in to clean up the mess and SLOC bid leader Tom Welch and SLOC vice president Dave Johnson were hit with 15 criminal counts that were dismissed, but recently appealed by the Justice Department.
Jacques Rogge, 59, the current president of the IOC, is trying to set a new tone for the Olympics.
A former Olympic athlete for Belgium, he stayed in the Olympic Village here instead of a five-star hotel.
Rogge, an orthopedic surgeon, is trying to replace pomp with matter-of-fact problem solving.
Yet, not everyone was pleased with Rogge.
Samaranch, among other things, had once been an ambassador for Spain to the Soviet Union.
Although Russia was at the 1996 Atlanta Games, it did not make the 1984 Los Angeles Games, returning the favor for an American boycott of the 1980 Moscow Summer Games.
The Soviet Union used to dominate the Winter Olympics.
In 1964 the Soviets won 25 medals, including 11 golds.
The U.S. had six medals, with one gold.
The Russians have never finished behind the U.S. since joining the Winter Games in 1956, not even when the Games were held on U.S. soil in 1960 and 1980.
Now, they're trailing the U.S. by almost a 2-1 margin in medals.
The officiating in the Friday hockey semifinal game with the U.S. was their most recent complaint of Bear baiting.
Hockey coach Slava Fetisov said of the National Hockey League officials who worked the Games, ``They know the players.
They're Americans.
They're Canadians.''
Others were beginning to tire of the complaints.
The Russians, at least, didn't pack their bags and go home.
Before these Olympics, Romney wondered aloud whether the U.S. should ever again incur the costs and the headaches of hosting another Olympics.
Friday, he thought about it for a second and said, ``I think we have to.''
In the final judgment, the Games that had to go on for so many reasons did.
Salt Lake takes home the gold.

SALT LAKE CITY GETS RAVES FOR ITS GAMES
SALT LAKE CITY - Despite a skating scandal and contentious press conferences, despite stringent security and occasional charges of overcommercialism, the Salt Lake 2002 Olympic Games may be remembered in coming months and years as the best in winter history.
And that is an upset almost as big as Sarah Hughes winning the women's skating gold.
Barring a terror attack today, the final day of the games, or a rash of positive doping cases, or a particularly virulent outbreak of bad sportsmanship, Salt Lake 2002 will end on a roll, an Olympics that ran like a well-oiled machine.
But a machine with a soul.
``I've been to Olympics where everything went off like clockwork,'' said Bonny Warner, who has been to every Winter Games since 1980 as a volunteer, athlete or television commentator.
The efficiency of Salt Lake 2002 sometimes has been obscured by questionable judging.
But in the long term, the skillful execution of the XIXth Winter Olympiad likely will set the standard for subsequent organizers.
All that is left is for International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge, overseeing his first Closing Ceremonies tonight, to put the IOC stamp of excellence on Salt Lake 2002.
His predecessor, Juan Antonio Samaranch, typically praised each Olympics (with the notable exception of Atlanta 1996) as ``the best-organized games ever.''
If Rogge follows in Samaranch's footsteps, it seems unavoidable that Salt Lake 2002 will gain the ``best-ever'' distinction, and deserve it.
Two years ago, success here seemed anything but a sure thing.
The Salt Lake Organizing Committee was mired in a vote-buying scandal going back to the 1995 IOC decision to return the Winter Olympics to the United States.
One key venue, the Utah Olympic Oval, was behind schedule in construction.
Enthusiasm in Utah for the Olympics was flagging.
Then came Sept. 11, and fears of an Olympics bloodied by terror.
Some suggested the games be canceled, or moved.
SLOC seemed to lose momentum again.
But under the leadership of SLOC President and CEO Mitt Romney, the organizing committee righted itself after the scandal and reoriented itself after 9-11 and showed the world's athletes a great time.
When the crowd files out of Rice-Eccles Stadium tonight at the end of Closing Ceremonies, Salt Lake 2002 will have sold in excess of 1.5 million tickets, taken in more than $180 million in ticket revenue and handled more than 70,000 visitors to its venues each day.
Records for a Winter Games.
Obscure (to Americans) sports such as biathlon and cross-country skiing will have been seen by crowds in excess of 10,000, and mainstream sports such as skating and hockey will have played to capacity audiences night after night -- at state-of-the-art venues.
Certainly, the competition has been memorable.
This was the Olympics that American multiculturalism made its mark in the Winter Games, with bobsledder Vonetta Flowers gaining the first gold medal by an African-American and speedskater Parra the first gold by a Mexican-American.
Speedskater Jennifer Rodriguez became the first Cuban-American to win a medal.
Ole Einar Bjoerndalen won four gold medals, in biathlon and cross-country skiing, leaving him one short of Eric Heiden's record five golds in 1980.
Janica Kostelic of Croatia became the first Alpine skier, male or female, to win four medals, three gold, at a single games.
Unassuming Jochem Uytdehaage set three world records and won three medals in speedskating.
There were great stories and great comments.
You knew who the major sponsors here were, but you weren't beaten over the head with their logos.
Foreign complaints about American corporate culture seemed muted.
Important, too, was the unobtrusive role the Mormon church took in Salt Lake 2002.
Utah is 70 percent Mormon, and there were fears before the games that Mormon mores on caffeine and alcohol would be forced down the throats of visitors, and tracts forced into their hands.
That never developed, and Mormonism was confined, to most visitors, to Tabernacle Square.
Certainly, Salt Lake 2002 had its low points.
There was the skate judging scandal that obscured other developments for almost a week.
There were traffic jams, early on, at some of the Alpine venues.
And a case can be made that SLOC spending $1.3 billion on these games was too much for 17 days of competition.
But in the grand scheme of things, Salt Lake 2002 worked better than anyone had a right to expect.
It gave the world a grand party in times of global anxiety and doubt.
X X X
Was that underrated underdog Sarah Hughes or underrated underdog Tom Brady?
China speed skater Yang Yang A or China speed skater Yang Yang S?
A controversial judging scam in figure skating or a controversial voting scam in college football's BCS?
Americans might have been confused by what they were watching during the Winter Olympics, but there's no uncertainty that they indeed were watching.
The Salt Lake Games and NBC's coverage had serious hiccups, but neither scandals nor shameless patriotism prevented viewers from tuning in at record levels.
Even before Sunday's prestigious men's U.S.-Canada hockey final and the Closing Ceremonies were factored in, NBC's coverage enjoyed an average 19.0 rating, a 15 percent increase from the '98 Nagano Games on CBS.
Furthermore, during its 17-day coverage NBC won every hour of prime-time ratings with 23 percent more viewers than CBS, ABC and Fox combined.
It also chose to run a seemingly nightly feature about the U.S. team's snappy berets, which _ just coincidentally _ are available for purchase on nbcolympics.com.
NBC's cameras and commentators, however, used pristine pictures and words to tell the stories of the most-watched Winter Olympics in history.
With events such as snowboarding and skeleton and a younger, more hip slant on prime-time programming with performances by 'N Sync, the Salt Lake Games drew a 23 percent increase in male viewers ages 18-34 over the Nagano Games.
As expected, women's figure skating was the Games' marquee event, drawing a 26.8 rating for Thursday's surprising victory by Hughes over Michelle Kwan.
That event drew the largest Thursday night TV audience for any network show since NBC's ``Seinfeld'' finale May 14, 1998.
Hockey was also a ratings winner, with the U.S.-Russia men's semifinal Friday drawing the largest Olympic cable audience ever.
Overall, about 84 percent of all U.S. television households tuned in to some part of NBC's coverage, a total of about 184 million.
``When you think that they [the United States] have 34 medals, when the most they've ever won is 13, that says a lot,'' Ebersol said.
``When the United States reached its low ebb with the Winter Games in Calgary in '88 and won only six medals, it was his commission that really locked the USOC into making sure that a significant amount of money was set aside to help athletes simply live during training.
That's made a pronounced difference in the way the U.S. medal count in the Winter Games has grown in recent years.''
Called a ``halo effect,'' NBC's Olympic coverage also strengthened its viewership across the network.
CNBC's ratings, for example, almost tripled, while MSNBC nearly quadrupled its audience.
Olympic programming helped power ``NBC Nightly News'' to its largest advantage over ABC News since the advent of people meters in 1987.
The ``Today'' show's lead over ``Good Morning America'' grew by 50 percent during the Games.
Also during the Olympics, NBC delivered a record Daytona 500 rating (10.9), the highest NBA All-Star Game rating (8.2) since '98 and its highest-rated NBA regular-season game (LA Lakers-Portland, 5.1) since '99.nn
CHINA PLANNING A MANNED SPACE MISSION FOR THIS YEAR
China plans to launch a manned capsule into orbit around Earth by the end of the year, accelerating a costly program designed to challenge American pre-eminence in space, official media reported on Thursday.
The mission would make China the third nation, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, to put people into orbit using rockets from its own program, a goal China has pursued since Mao Zedong began a space program in the early 1970s.
China's push to put an astronaut in space came as its unmanned Shenzhou IV spacecraft orbited Earth for a fourth day in what space program administrators said was a final dry-run for a manned flight.
Previously, officials said they expected to put an astronaut in orbit by 2005.
``Shenzhou V will be manned,'' the head of the Shanghai Aerospace Institute, Yuan Jie, said in official news reports.
European nations and Japan have developed commercial vehicles for launching satellites but have not pushed ahead for full-fledged space programs.
China also has ambitions for developing new industries in space and putting astronauts on the Moon and Mars.
NASA has not said when it intends to send a manned mission to Mars.
China's preparation for manned space flight has been intensive.
China sent astronauts to train in Russia in 1996 and has recently prepared at least a dozen people for space travel at a secret facility.
The Shenzhou spacecraft are converted Soviet space capsules from the 1960s that China says can carry people into orbit and return safely.
On previous missions of the Shenzhou, or ``divine mission,'' vehicles, China sent a dog, a rabbit, snails and mannequins into space.
The latest Shenzhou craft, which blasted off from the Jiuquan space center in the Gobi desert just after midnight on Monday, carried life-support equipment and other facilities needed for human beings, the government said.
Most details about China's space program are considered state secrets, reflecting military sponsorship.
The government does not announce dates for missions, and the state-controlled news media report on them only if they are successful.
But the Communist Party has promoted its space program as evidence of rising technological prowess and has used it to stir up patriotic feelings.
State media have also begun to extol China's astronauts, anonymous pilots culled from China's air force, in a way reminiscent of the enthusiasm that surrounded the buildup to the U.S. Apollo missions in the 1960s.
It remains uncertain when he will leave that post.
China has lifted payloads into orbit since the first Long March rocket took off in 1970.
Since then, China has completed nearly 75 launchings and has sold satellite-launching services to Western companies for a decade.
But the program has also hit rough patches.
The Long March rockets have had about a dozen failures.
A rocket with an American-made telecommunications satellite aboard exploded on takeoff in 1995, killing six people on the ground.
The following year another rocket put a $120 million Chinese satellite into the wrong orbit, rendering it useless.
CHINESE SPACE EFFORT CHALLENGES RUSSIA AND U.S.
Even as the United States and Russia grow cautious about the cost of exploring other worlds, China is taking the first steps to challenging their longtime pre-eminence in space.
Beijing plans to launch a manned capsule into orbit around Earth by the end of the year, speeding up an effort intended to showcase its growing technological abilities and to take advantage of the scientific, military and commercial potential of space.
The launching would make China the third nation, after the United States and the former Soviet Union, to put astronauts into orbit using its own rockets, a goal China has pursued since Mao Zedong began a space program in the early 1970s.
Chinese space program officials are describing the current flight of the Shenzhou IV, an unmanned craft, as a final dry run for the manned flight.
Shenzhou IV is in its fourth day orbiting Earth.
Officials had previously said they did not expect to put an astronaut into orbit until 2005.
Europe and Japan have developed commercial launching vehicles for satellites but have not built full-fledged space programs.
China also has ambitions of developing new industries in space and putting people on both the moon and Mars.
NASA has not said when it intends to pursue a Mars mission.
It remains uncertain when he will leave that post.
Preparations for manned space flight have been intensive.
China sent astronauts to train in Russia in the 1990s and has recently prepared at least a dozen people for space travel at a secret facility outside Beijing.
The Shenzhou spacecraft are converted Soviet capsules from the 1960s that China says can carry people into orbit and return safely.
On previous launchings of the Shenzhou, or ``divine mission,'' vehicles, China sent a dog, a rabbit, snails and dummy astronauts.
The Shenzhou IV, which blasted off from the Jiuquan space center in the Gobi Desert just after midnight on Monday, carried life-support equipment for human beings, the government said.
Most details about China's space program are kept secret.
But the Communist Party has also promoted it as evidence of rising technological prowess.
Official media have begun to extol China's astronauts in a way reminiscent of enthusiasm for the Apollo missions in the 1960s.
AFTER ASTRONAUT'S SUCCESS, CHINA VOWS QUICK RETURN TO SPACE
Within hours of the safe return of the Shenzhou 5 early Thursday, China pledged to return to space within one or two years, as officials outlined a short-term space agenda that included space walks, space docking and the possible construction of a space lab or space station.
The swift commitment underscored the confidence and enthusiasm infused into the space program by the Shenzhou 5 mission, which established China as the third nation to send a human into space.
He was quickly flown to Beijing, where he passed a physical examination.
Later in the day, in an interview on state television, he described the wonders of space and also what he had not seen.
``But I did not see the Great Wall.''
Zhou Xiaofei, the director of manned space engineering, said at a news conference that China had busy space plans in coming years, including a another piloted Shenzhou mission within a year or two.
He listed the immediate priorities as, in order, space walking, mastering the docking of space vehicles and e1tablishing a space lab.
``Our plans are in their first stages,'' he said of a space lab.
``The space lab won't be anything like Mir or the International Space Station.''
In addition, Chinese officials plan within three years to begin orbiting and exploring the moon sidj unpiloted probes and to build a Hubble-like space telescope.
There is talk of a Mars mission one day.
The government also offered a rare glimpse into its budget.
Western estimates of China's space budget are typically about $2 billion a year.
The government now says its program for humans in space, including the first four unpiloted launchings, has cost roughly $2.2 billion, which would seem remarkably low by American or European standards, but China has a reputation for being thrifty, and costs are lower here.
``The United States and Russia are much more experienced than we are, and we're quite willing to learn from them,'' Xie said, according to a report by the official news media.
Washington has been wary of space partner{harted their future, other officials were already cranking up their public relations efforts.
The government will print 10.2 million sets of commemorative stamps in honor of the mission, and Yang has already become as visible on television as President Hu Jintao.
It is hard, though, to gauge the depth of public enthusiasm for the mission and how much domestic good will it will generate for the government.
Many people interviewed at random in Beijing and Shanghai had never heard of the Shenzhou 5.
But many others had followed developments closely and expressed deep pride that China was maturing into a technological power.
EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT CHINA'S FIRST MAN IN SPACE SHOULD LEARN
I don't know how many of them remain, but when I was a correspondent in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, there wasn't a single city, town or even village across the entire 11 time zones that didn't havd e Gagarin Street.
Many also had Gagarin Squares, quite a few had Gagarin Institutes or Gagarin Schools, and many had Gagarin statues.
No Soviet figure, except the deified Lenin, was more exalted in the Soviet firmament than Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space.
A major part of his allure for the creators of official myths, of course, was that he was not a political figure, `n` so not subject to retroactive debunking, like every Soviet ruler after Lenin.
I mulled all this as I followed the brief odyssey of Lt.Col.Yang Liwei, the first man sent into space by China.
That's not the only difference, of course.
Spaceflight was still the stuff of Jules Vernu how that flight stunned America.
It was the peak of the Cold War, when every ``first'' symbolized ideological and technological supremacy.
Three and a half years earlier, the Kremlin had sent up the first satellite, and now the first man.
``Let the capitalist countries try to catch up,'' Nikita Khrushchev said, gloating in the Kremlin.
There will be military implications to ponder but, to be frank, it is hard to get too excited.
Still, I can't help suspecting that the Communist rulers in Beijing launched Yang into space for many of the same reasons that the Kremlin sent Gagarin up.
Authoritarian regimes are forever in search of spectacular displays to assert their greatness and legitimacy, and to divert people from whatever subversive complaints and frustrations they may harbor.
The vast squares, grandiose monuments, huge demonstrations and endless self-praise are as much a fixture of these regimes as secrecy and intolerance.
China's rulers probably expect some tangible economic and military benefits from manned flight, but I would bet that their primary hope is to lift their standing at home and with the world.
Apart from the deja vu of it all, they might ponder what good it did the Soviet state or Gagarin.
He was killed in a jet fighter accident just seven years after his spaceflight, and, in the peculiar fate Russians reserved for official heroes of Soviet propaganda, his legend was systematically taken apart piece by piece in the streets.
According to ``firm'' reports, he crashed because he was drunk, or because he was trying to shoot deer from his MiG, or because he had smuggled a woman into his cockpit.
However personable or heroic he may really have been, entry into the Soviet propaganda pantheon spelled death in the streets.
He seems a decent type, and I will always be in awe, and jealous, of anyone who can say what Gagarin said: ``I can observe Earth . . .
One can see everything.
'' It has to change your life, no matter how often it is done.
That's something Yang will want to hold onto, so perhaps he should ask President Hu Jintao and the others to build their statues to themselves.
GENERAL SUGGESTS ABUSES AT IRAQ JAIL WERE ENCOURAGED
But the officer, Brig. Gen. Janis Karpinski of the 800th Military Police Brigade, said the special high-security cellblock at the Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, where the abuses took place had been under the tight control of a separate group of military intelligenc% oGficers who had so far avoided any public blame.
In her first public comments about the brutality _ which drew wide attention and condemnation after photographs documenting it were broadcast Wednesday night by CBS News _ Karpinski said that while the reservists involved were ``bad people'' and deserved punishment, she suspected they were acting with the encouragement, if not at the direction, of military intelligence units that ran the special cellblock used for interrogation.
Well, it's not going to go away.''
She said the special cellblock, known as 1A, was one of about two dozen in the large prison and was essentially off-limits to soldiers who were not part of the interrogations.
She said repeatedly in the interview that she was not defending the actions of the reservists who took part in the brutality, who were part of her command.
``I put my head down because I really thought I was going to throw up,'' she said.
``It was awful.
``They were in there at 2 in the morning, they were at 4 in the afternoon,'' said Karpinski, who arrived in Iraq last June and who was the only woman to hold a command in the war zone.
``This was no 9-to-5 job.''
The photographs of American soldiers smiling, laughing and signaling ``thumbs up'' as Iraqi detainees were forced into sexually humiliating positions provoked outrage just as the American military was seeking to pacify a rising insurgency and gain the trust of more Iraqis before turning over sovereignty to a new government on June 30.
Karpinski, who has returned to South Carolina and her civilian profession as a business consultant, said she visited Abu Ghraib as often as twice a week last fall and had repeatedly instructed military police officers under her command to treat prisoners humanely and in accord with international human rights agreements.
``I can speak some Arabic,'' she said.
``I'm not fluent, but when I went to any of my prison facilities, I would make it a point to try to talk to the detainees.''
She stressed that she had received no reports from any of her commanders of possible prisoner abuses in the cellblock.
After the first allegations of abuse circulated earlier this year, Lt. Gen. Ricardo S.Sanchez, the senior American commander in Iraq, ordered sweeping inquiries into whether any commanders _ including Karpinski _ should be held responsible.
He also ordered a review of policies and procedures at all of the prisons controlled by occupation forces in Iraq.
The administrative review, known in the military criminal justice system as an AR15-6, was completed March 1 by Army Maj.Gen.Antonio M. Taguba, who had assembled a team of officers trained in military detention.
The report was approved by his superior, Lt. Gen. David D.McKiernan, commander of American ground forces in the Middle East, and forwarded to Sanchez on April 4.
The finding documented the abuses illustrated by the photographs circulating last week, as well as other problems in the military's detainee system in Iraq.
SOLDIERS NOT SOLELY TO BLAME IN ABUSE, GENERAL CA[
The New Yorker magazine said in its new edition that the report by Maj. Gen. Antonio M.Taguba found that reservist military police at the prison were urged by Army military officers and CIA agents to ``set physical and mental conditions for favorable interrogation of witnesses.''
According to the New Yorker article, the Army report offered accounts of rampant and gruesome abuse from October to December of 2003 that included the sexual assault of an Iraqi detainee with a chemical light stick or broomstick.
While reports of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American and British soldiers have come to light in the last several days, the report cited by The New Yorker indicates a far more wide-ranging and systematic pattern of cruelties than previously reported.
Karpinski was formally admonished in January and ``quietly suspended'' from commanding the me in South Carolina in which she offered her first public comments about the growing international furor over the abuse of the Iraq detainees, Karpinski said the special high-security cellblock at Abu Ghraib had been under the direct control of Army intelligence officers, not the reservists under her command.
She said that while the reservists involved in the abuses were ``bad people'' who deserved punishment, she suspected that they were acting with the encouragement, if not at the direction, of military intelligence units that ran the special cellblock used for interrogation.
She said that CIA employees often joined in the interrogations at the prison, although she said she did not know if they had unrestricted access to the cellblock.
According to the New Yorker article, by the investigative journalist Seymour M. Hersh, one of the soldiers under investigation, Staff Sgt.Ivan L. Frederick II, an Army reservist who is a prison guard in civilian life, may have reinforced Karpinski's contention in e-mails to family and friends while serving at the prison.
'' He described ``such things as leaving inmates in their cell with no clothes or in female underpants, handcuffing them to the door of their cell.
'' He added, ``The answer I got was, `This is how military intelligence wants it done.'''
Prisoners were beaten and threatened with rape, electrocution and dog attacks, witnesses told Army investigators, according to the report obtained by The New Yorker.
Much of the abuse was sexual, with prisoners often kept naked and forced to perform simulated and real sex acts, witnesses testified.
Hersh notes that such degradations, while deeply offensive in any culture, are particularly humiliating to Arabs because Islamic law and culture so strongly condemn nudity and homosexuality.
Well, it's not going to go away.''
The Army's public affairs office at the Pentagon referred calls about her comments to military commanders in Iraq.
Karpinski said in the interview that the special cellblock, known as 1A, was one of about two dozen cellblocks in the large prison complex and was essentially off limits to soldiers who were not part of the interrogations, including virtually all of the military police under her command at Abu Ghraib.
She said repeatedly in the interview that she was not defending the actions of the reservists who took part in the brutality, who were part of her command.
``I put my head down because I really thought I was going to throw up,'' she said.
``It was awful.
``The suggestion that this was done f this.
She estimated that the floor space of the two-story cellblock was only about 60 feet by 20 feet, and that military intelligence officers were in and out of the cellblock ``24 hours a dqxl+' often to escort prisoners to and from an interrogation center away from the prison cells.
``They were in there at 2 in the morning, they were there at 4 in the afternoon,'' said Karpinski, who arrived in Iraq last June and was the only woman to hold a command in the war zone.
``This was no 9-to-5 job.''
She said that CIA employees often participated in the interrogations at Abu Ghraib, one of Iraq's most notorious prisons during the rule of Saddam Hussein.
Karpinski noted that one of the photographs of abused prisoners also showed the legs of 16 American soldiers _(tHa photograph was cropped so that their upper bodies could not be seen _ ``and that tells you that clearly other people were participating, because I didn't have 16 people assigned to that cellblock.''

OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
The photographs of American soldiers smiling, laughing and signaling ``thumbs up'' as Iraqi detainees were forced into sexually humiliating positions provoked outrage just as the American military was trying to pacify a rising insurgency and gain the trust of more Iraqis before turning over sovereignty to a new government on June 30.
Karpinski, who has returned home to South Carolina and her civilian life as a business consultant, said she visited Abu Ghraib as often as twice a week last fall and had repeatedly instructed military police officers under her command to treat prisoners humanely and in accord with international human rights agreements.
``I can speak some Arabic,'' said Karpinski, a New Jersey native who spent almost a decade as an active duty soldier before joining the Army Reserve in 1987.
``I'm not fluent, but when I went to any of my prison facilities, I would make it a point to try to talk to the detainees.''
She was referring to the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been given access over time to Iraqi detainees at the prison.
He said Karpinski had repeatedly insisted that troops under her command in Iraq receive instruction in proper treatment of detainees, but that despite her best efforts, some reservists joined in the abuse at Abu Ghraib.
``All you can do is give training, give guidance and assume that your soldiers are going to follow orders and are not going to become sick bastards,'' he said.
After the first allegations of abuse circulated earlier this year, Lt. Gen. Ricardo S.Sanchez, the senior American commander in Iraq, ordered sweeping inquiries into whether any commanders _ includnd procedures at all of the prisons controlled by occupation forces in Iraq.
COMMENTARY
The prison complex at Abu Ghraib earned a nightmarish reputation under former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Now it appears an unknown number of American solders have ensured the prison's reputation outlived the regime.
While the vast majority of uniformed personnel in Iraq carry out their duties with professionalism and restraint, those who commit acts such as this undermine the mission in Iraq and harm America's international reputation.
The United States must not tolerate these acts and must ensure such violations do not occur as it again works to build confidence in its activities in Iraq.
Most citizens are now familiar with the images of sadistic cruelty of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib.
However, they may not be familiar with the 53-page internal military report written by Maj. Gen. Antonio M.Taguba, published last week in The New Yorker, that outlines the extent of the transgressions.
In stomach-turning detail, the report catalogues the physical, mental and sexual abuse perpetrated on Iraqi prisoners, and names those believed responsible for the torture.
Now, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo S.Sanchez, has recommended the most severe reprimand for the six supervisors of the pris the reassignment of Brig. Gen. Janis Karpild seem important steps toward apportioning blame for the despicable acts at Abu Ghraib.
Yet, troubling questions Remqin.
One enlisted man charged in the abuse, Staff Sgt.Ivan Frederick, says he was instructed to ``soften up'' the detainees as preparation for questioning by military intelligenbe* Gen.Karpinski, has made similar protestations, claiming that reservists are taking a fall for active-duty soldiers and military intelligence's instructions.
If the Taguba report can be trusted, the abuse occurred, without repercussion, between October and December, and was not stopped until late January.
President Bush already says an investigation is under way, but he also seems comfortable in attributing these acts to a few misguided soldiers.
Yet, if this is a chain-of-command failure as some details suggest a more thorough investigation will be needed to prevent future abuses.
The claims made by Frederick and Karpinski suggest the problem is more endemic and will require concerted effort to resolve.
These acts have harmed the American mission in Iraq.
U.S. soldiers may face more intense resistance on the ground and international opinion is again inflamed.
The only hope is that the repercussions of these events ensure such violations never occur again.

DEATHS IN IRAQ PRISONER SCANDAL RISE TO 14
DEATHS IN IRAQ PRISONER SCANDAL RISE TO 14
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By STEWART M.POWELL

2004 Hearst Newspapers
WASHINGTON _ Investigators on Wednesday raised the suspected death toll in the prisoner abuse sccnl`l to at least 14 detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 17 months, with the addition of at least two deaths now under scrutiny by the Central Intelligence Agency.
Disclosure that criminal investigators were expanding inquiries beyond Army personnel to include CIA interrogators came as President Bush offered conciliatory remarks in televised remarks to Iraqis and the Arab world.
Bush stopped short of apologizing but White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan did so later.
The White House effort at damage control underscored the stakes in a fast-moving crisis that complicates U.S. plans to hand off political control of Iraq to a U.N.-created interim government on June 30 and to negotiate new arrangements with the incoming Iraqi government to allow continued U.S. military occupation there.
The costs of dealing with the escalating Iraqi insurgency prompted t`eFush administration to ask Congress for a $25 billion emergency downpayment on next year's spending for Iraq and Afghanistan to sustain intensified military operations.
Rockefeller added: ``This is worldwide in its implications.
'' 0"A U.S. intelligence official who requested anonymity told the Associated Press the CIA inspector general was investigating two deaths involving CIA interrogators _ one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan.
The CIA had no immediate comment on the report.
The additional suspicious deaths brought to 14 the number of prisoner deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan that are under Army or CIA investigation.
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld raised the prospect of financial compensation for abuse victims and their families as Army, Navy Cnl1CIA investigators scoured detention facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and the U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C., for any evidence of prisoner abuse against detainees.
The prisoners include suspected al-Qaida terrorists.
Asked whether Rumsfelv0ougx|;7r Vietnam prisoner of war, said he didn't think ``you could reach that conclusion yet.''
Sen.John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate ArOel1Services Committee, announced that Rumsfeld and Gen.
Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would appear before the full Senate on Friday for a close-door briefing after appearing for two hours of public testimony before the armed services panel.
Bush tried to cool the firestorm that has engulfed the Arab world by granting televised interviews with two Arabic-language satellite television stations.
'' Bush said that a ``dictator wouldn't admit reforms needed to be done.''
Bush told the U.S.-financed Al Hurra Arabic-language satellite television station that ``mistakes will be investigated,'' adding: ``We have nothing to hide.''
b The defense secretary, appearing on ABC-TV, raised the prospect of financial damages to abused prisoners.
``From time-to-time various types of compensation and assistance had been provided to people in Iraq whose circumstances were altered unfairly,'' he said.

(OPTIONAL TRIM _ STORY MAY END HERE.)
--
Democratic members of Congress urged House-Senate passage of a resolution condemning abuse of detainees at the hands of American soldiers and possibly CIA interrogators.
Rockefeller said lawmake2s+in the GOP-led Congress needed to collectively express ``profound shock (and) outrage'' because ``silence in the Arab world is an admission and silence is saying we're guilty.''

SOLDIER SENTENCED TO 8 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ROLE IN ABU GHRAIB ABUSES
A military court sentenced Staff Sgt.Ivan L. Frederick on Thursday to eight years in prison for abusing Iraqi prisoners last year in the grim chambers of Abu Ghraib.
It was the harshest sentence yet handed down in the abuse hearings, involving the highest-ranked enlisted soldier of the eight charged in the scandal.
Two others have been convicted.
The judge, Col.James A. Pohl, also reduced Frederick's rank to private, and ordered him dishonorably discharged.
The sergeant was originally sentenced to 10 years in prison, but that term was reduced to eight years through a plea bargain that also calls for forfeiture of pay.
The bargain requires Frederick to cooperate in the pending cases.
Frederick pleaded guilty to eight counts of abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison, 15 miles west of Baghdad, in October and November of 2003.
In court, he described in graphic detail how he forced Arab prisoners to masturbate, punched a hooded prisoner and attached wires to another standing on a flimsy box who was made to believe he would be

If the Bank of England had cut rates, said Philippe Legrain, the chief economist for Britain in Europe, a pro-euro advocacy group, the pound would have fallen further.
``The real message,'' said Barry Bright, an Ernst &amp; Young spokesman, in a press release, ``is that overall economic factors are more important in attracting investment than membership or nonmembership of the euro.''
`pWe are heading to a new debate about a European Union with much larger internal differences.''
The distinctions seem likely to persist.
Analysts here said the Swedish vote might encourage euroskeptics in Denmark, which rejected euro membership three years ago.
``This was an anti-establishment cry,'' said Goran Rosenberg, a leading Swedish columnist.
``This was a sign or a warning, and not just for Sweden.''
"They have their weak points and they have their strong points, and life is difficult for all of them," said the president of the bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, at a news conference here.
"It wouldn't be in the interest of these countries to be in the euro zone right now," said Katinka Barysch, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London.
Public and private comments by central bankers and other officials here have been noticeably more relaxed since the beginning of January, when the dollar reversed its relentless decline against the euro -- even though economists caution that underlying trends have not changed.
"What central bankers really hate is a very quick appreciation in their currency," said Jorg Kramer, a senior economist at the HVB Group in Munich.
"I'm not sure anymore whether the euro-dollar rate is such an enormous hurdle, especially for German industry," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London.
Trichet, among other officials, said he took Snow's remarks very seriously.
In this hilly corner of Bohemia -- so bitterly fought over when it was called the Sudetenland before World War II -- European integration has done better in guaranteeing peace than prosperity.
"That debate is going to become a lot sharper over the next few months."
Gros said that if the Italian government did not arrest the slide, it could lose a decade's worth of work in preparing itself to adopt the euro.
"This alienation between Europe and its public must be overcome, and therefore in my opinion, we need an honest debate about Turkish membership," Merkel told supporters in Berlin.
Berlusconi did not endorse the idea, but neither did he denounce it.
But different budget allocations may have resulted in a stronger safety organization, with members present at all the right meetings.
A. I think your editors were asking if NASA, as structured today, is capable of operating the program we've got and, in particular, an aging space shuttle fleet.
"I don't think we thought a year ago that it would take so long to get the shuttle ready for flight."
"In a company, changing culture is essentially about leadership."
"Space flight is risky," Griffin said.
For the shuttle, he said, "this is the beginning of the end."
" He works alongside engineers whom he battled with during the Columbia mission, he said, and "we have a congenial working relationship."
Do I think the system has changed enough? No."
``My own view would be to let him bluster, let him rant and rave all he wants and let that be a matter between he and his own country,'' Armey said in response to a reporter's question.
``As long as he behaves himself within his own borders, we should not be addressing any attack or resources against him.''
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said Saddam's speech did not alter Bush's view of Iraq.
The White House had little reaction to Armey's comments.
``He has a right to hold dominion within his own national boundaries, as obnoxious as he is and as comical as he can be,'' said Armey.
``There are very few Americans who believe Saddam Hussein is not a threat and should stay in power.
US officials described the demonstrations as a new freedom of expression for Iraqis that was not allowed under Saddam Hussein.
``The United States of America does not want to run Iraq,'' Chalabi said.
Americans were made to believe we could defuse the most dangerous nation on earth in a bargain-basement rout.
Dobbs said anti-war campaigners are focusing on Congress in an attempt to end funding for the war.

A World Health Organization team seeking to clarify the situation in Beijing has visited a few hospitals and pored over records, making what team members described as slow, steady progress.
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta don't completely discount the e&amp;feBtiveness of herbal preventative medicine, but say there haven't been enough studies to draw conclusions.
``If the body is strong your immune system is strong,'' says Muy Ear, who works at a Chinatown herb shop called Hing Fat Co.
``If you're strong and healthy, you don't have to worry about this SARS.''
Dr.Barry R. Bloom, the dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, said choosing a specific incubation period is ``arbitrary for an agent that we don't know much about.''
But there is ``not a specific day when all hat is likely to detect the most severe cases yet could miss milder ones.
In the hills southwest of Beijing, authorities haven't shown much interest in SARS prevention.
Stringent precautions are a key feature in controlling any future spread of SARS, two teams of researchers said in the papers published Friday.
The second group, from England and Hong Kong, argued that such efforts have already proven their usefulness, by reducing the once-explosive spread of SARS in Hong Kong to the current trickle of several cases a day.
``SARS is probably here to stay,'' said spokesman Llelwyn Grant of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
President Bush called the blackout ``a wake-up call'' to modernize the nation's power-sharing system.
``But it wasn't too bad.''
Other power industry officials said there were some signs that the trouble might have started in Michigan.
Energy officials called the situation tenuous and said it was critical for people to conserve electricity to avoid rolling blackouts.
Michael Holstein, vice president and chief financial officer at the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, which helps manage electrical flows on the grid for certain companies in the region where the blackout began, called the Cambridge Energy scenario ``an interesting hypothesis.''
Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent System Operator, said events also moved too quickly for humans to react and keep the state from going dark.
``It is likely that the automated controls tripped some transmission lines moments before they would have burned down because of extremely high power flows out of our system,'' said Henry Fayne, American Electric's executive vice president for energy delivery.
At that point, Stauffer said, a blackout was inevitable.
Opponents say those lines have become increasingly overloaded as more companies use them to transmit more power over longer distances.
Many observers of the electricity industry, however, either question or dispute the notion that this month's problems can be attributed to deregulation.
``To say it was due to deregulation or not at this point is premature,'' said Ellen Raines, a spokeswoman for FirstEnergy Corp., an Ohio company that owned or partly owned transmission lines that went out of service just before the blackout.
He said deregulation is ``one of many factors that may have contributed'' to the problem.
Even Brian McCarthy, deregulation coordinator for the utility workers union and a passionate critic of deregulation, stopped short of predicting that the blackout will ultimately be attributed to a failure to invest in infrastructure improvements as a direct result of deregulation.
Companies might have invested more in transmission improvements if they believed they could profit from them without having to abide by government rules that restrict what they can recoup from spending on transmission, said Jonathan Adler, an assistant law professor at Case Western Reserve University who specializes in environmental and regulatory law.
But he said Ohio's deregulation law did play a role in discouraging Ohio utilities from investing in the power grid because it imposed a five-year rate freeze on FirstEnergy and other power companies.
``Other countries that supported Bush, like Italy and Poland, could be next in line.''
While the general public in Europe may not have felt at direct risk before the Mqtridic opinion will catch up with government and expert opinion in having a realistic appraisal of the extent to which Islamic Jihadists pose a threat to Europe,'' said Gary Samore, a terrorism expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
He said that Germans should not feel exempt from terrorism because their government opposed the war in Iraq; the Germans do station troops in Afghanistan, for instance.
``If al-Qaida had the opportunity to blow up a train in Berlin,'' he asked, ``why would they hesitate?''
He describes the ease of buying false documents but stresses quality, saying, "If you don't know who used them, it is dangerous."
"With all he's got going for him, it's hard to believe Kerry is stumbling so badly here," said William P. Blair III, a Canton lawyer and lobbyist, a former Democrat and nominal Republican who now describes himself as an independent of sorts.
"I understand the need to put it behind him, given the math," said Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore's 2000 campaign for president.
"It's a tragedy but it is also an opportunity to demonstrate that terrorism doesn't drive out everything else," said Morton Abramowitz, who served as American ambassador to Thailand a quarter century ago and went on to become a co-founder of the International Crisis Group, which helps prepare governments to respond to unexpected shocks.
"I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help."

If Kyoto goes into force, foreign rather than U.S. companies making everything from wind energy to thermal windows will benefit from its provisions, said Jonathan Pershing of the World Resources Institute.
Pershing, a former deputy director of the State Department Office of Global Change who helped negotiate the treaty, said domestic producers in countries that are reducing greenhouse gases under the treaty will be favored over U.S. competitors.
"If America wants the rest of the world to be part of the agenda it has set," Blair said, "it must be part of their agenda, too."
There are many problems facing the world that are far more pressing than global warming: 5 million children in poverty, an AIDS/HIV crisis that is devastating sub-Saharan Africa, and the resurgence of vector-borne diseases like malaria (malariologists agree that global warming is not an important factor in their resurgence).
Our children will not thank us for stepping out down a road we know will lead to ruin, when the road to prosperity is well-marked.
Nathan Mantua, assistant director of the Center for Science in the Earth System at the University of Washington, which estimates the impact of global warming on the Northwest, said the coalition's efforts were laudable, but probably of limited global impact.
"It may be an environmentally significant step for air quality in the cities that are going to do this, but for the global warming problem it is a baby step.
But it is unusual in its open embrace of an international agreement the Bush administration has spurned and significant, Nickels's office said, because cities are huge contributors to the nation's overall emission of heat-trapping gases.
Beijing tolerated -- some say helped organize -- the protests last weekend to underscore its diplomatic dispute with Japan over history textbooks, oil and gas reserves in the East China Sea, and Japan's bid to join the U.N. Security Council.
"Nationalism is a double-edged sword," said a leading campaigner for peasant rights and rural health care.
Another man, a 23-year-old barber in central Shanghai, where several shops catering to Japanese were destroyed, said he had nothing against Japan or Japanese people.
"It is all right to express anger against Japan," advised Wu Jinglian, an economist at a government research institute, "but some actions do not necessarily best achieve our goal."
Yet many analysts agree that screening the Internet and cell phones is far more difficult than the practice of simply ordering state-controlled newspapers or television stations to censor a subject.
"Similar to Madrid, this will turn out to be a homegrown terrorist group that has no other connection to the disparate group we in American call al-Qaida than ideology," Bearden said.
"Al-Qaida has franchised to the point where it's almost impossible to determine whether a group is al-Qaida or not," said Anthony Cordesman, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank based in Washington.
The United States and Europe need to address the root cause of terrorism, said Peter Bergen, a terror analyst and author of a book about bin Laden.
There is a false assumption that al-Qaida operates like a business, said Robert Friedmann, a professor of criminal justice at George State University and author of a recent book on terrorism.
"If you get rid of Osama bin Laden tomorrow, there will be 15 leaders who will take his place."
"Madrid carried terror to the heart of Europe, but we never believed we would be a lonely, unique case," said Jorge Dezcallar, who was the head of Spain's foreign intelligence service during the Madrid attacks, in a telephone interview.
"We just had the bad luck of being chosen as the first target, but not the last.
He added, "That is always the logic of terrorism, to get the maximum attention and impact."
Counterterrorism officials had said they were worried that the prime target was the 122-year-old Underground, the world's busiest subway system, which ferries 3 million people each day.
"But we believe that the guy is worth more than what little he has been telling us."
A senior European intelligence official, who was briefed by Scotland Yard, said that "the British believe that the cell has been in the U.K. for some time, assimilating with the society."
"The attacks in London do not change the general threat we face here in the U.S." Bald said.
"What develops from the investigation of the London attacks could shed light on the threat situation in the U.S."
"This is what everyone has feared," Ranstorp said.
"Probably before long I will have forgotten about it.
It sounds dreadful but you just get on with life."
"I argue that it is a fundamental civil liberty of people in Europe to be able to go to work on their transport system in the morning without being blown up or subjected to terrorist attack or to conduct their lives without being at risk of serious and organized crime," he said.
"The question of civil liberties has to be treated in a proportionate way."
"The individual acts carried out by people in the name of resistance may or may not be heroic," he said.
But we'd like to suggest that Brown's departing statement is only half right.
Although some have warned for years of the doom that avian flu could wreak, the virus is getting new attention.
Experts are watching the avian flu, or bird flu, with heightened concern.
There are both frightening and promising implications in this week's announcement that research teams have deciphered the genetic sequence of the devastating 1918 influenza virus and have synthesized the lethal germ in a high-security laboratory.
"One of our major concerns is now the potential spread of avian influenza through migratory birds to North and Eastern Africa," said Dr. Joseph Domenech, the chief veterinary officer at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, which monitors the spread of the disease in animals.
"In birds, this is a disease of biblical proportions and it is difficult to control in a setting where people depend on poultry as a major source of protein for growing children," said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of surveillance and response at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
As bird flu has jumped this year from Southeast Asia to China, Russia, Kazakhstan and -- more recently -- into the Balkan region of Europe, scientists have become somewhat belatedly convinced that wild migratory birds are one of the main carriers of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.
"In birds this is a disease of biblical proportions, and it is difficult to control in a setting where people depend on poultry as a major source of protein for growing children," said Dr. Mike Ryan, Director of surveillance and response at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
Poor farmers may chose not to report deaths for fear of losing their birds.
"There are probably lots of people there who were exposed and got sick for a couple of days and fought it off."
? "Once there is better surveillance of populations surrounding the cases we know about, people will find the death rate is a lot less than 50 percent," he predicted.
"There is this dance between viral evolution and human activity and history and technology," said Dr.David Ozonoff, an environmental health specialist at the Boston University School of Public Health.
"An urgency" exists to do more research to determine the most effective anti-viral treatment for any strain that might mutate to cause a human pandemic of influenza, said an influenza expert at the World Health Organization.
Scientists have predicted that the A (H5N1) strain would become resistant to Tamiflu in an unknown percentage of cases.

"I think we must do our best to investigate the cause, to prevent a repeat, and to implement safety measures," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told reporters.
"We had never expected such rapid corrosion."
"We must put all our effort into determining the cause of the accident and to ensuring safety," Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said.
"We have to pay close attention so that our lives won't be affected by this accident."
The Yomiuri, a conservative newspaper, warned: "Care must be taken not to overemphasize the dangers involved in the operation of nuclear power stations, which could lead to an overreaction.
Operations at other nuclear power plants must not be undermined."
Habermeyer added that the Crystal River site, while attractive, also has some disadvantages.
But he added that he hopes local residents and public officials will recognize what he said are the environmental and economic advantages of nuclear power as well.
Jia suggested that China was willing to hold talks with Chen, albeit on terms he had rejected in the past.
"We have no bias against whom we negotiate with, and are not unwilling to talk just because someone is in power," Jia said in a speech later broadcast on national television.
"From the perspective of an ordinary person, and as a businessman, I hope the governments of both sides can create a good environment in the future and get this going," Lin said.
