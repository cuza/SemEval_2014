Good post about Kyoto !
Charise, Thanks for stopping by.
People need to be more mindful of the choices they make in everything from 'what do I want for dinner?' to 'why should I buy one car instead of another?'
I see the entrepreneur as the best change-agent in this scenario.
You're so wise Mr. Dunhill.
Sometimes I wonder how I dare commment on your blogs at all, I guess I'm just shameless.
All the kids on MTV's Laguna Beach are doing it ...
Your insight is no more or less valuable than mine.
I think there's merit in environmentally-friendly products being hip.
Even more, I 'd like to see people become aware of the ramifications of consumer scenarios.
What I 'd really like to see is people seeing 'bad for the environment' as a fundamentally bad deal.
Thank you.
Likewise, we need to move toward a mindset that we can't upset global climate and ecology, just because coal is cheap.
A good post , and pretty fair .
But what you don't observe is that the EU, like the US, has basically followed a business-as-usual path on emissions.
Or seen from another country's point of view, since Japan is one of the most efficient , least polluting , highly industrialized nations in the world, their involvement in the protocol would be to simply purchase Carbon Credits, once again moving money from developed to undeveloped countries.
Now is the time to start thinking about how to engage all nations, including large emitters, in conversations about what to do after the treaty's expiration in 2012.
I think the Kyoto Protocol is a good idea .
" We are aiming , along with our donor partners in the G8 and beyond, at a global effort of up to 10 billion dollars over the next three years with the U.S. as the lead donor,
Good .
I'm glad to hear not.
And I 'm happy to say America never agreed.
It 's important to keep in mind that the news media (on the whole) are for-profit operations.
Interesting tidbits to chew on, at the least.
That was wonderfully stated , Marc.
As an avid camper and hiker, I am sypathetic to much of the environmental movement's aims, and wish these issues could be less partisan.
An achievement compared to the imminent alternatives we are facing.
first, this was a fantastic post . good sheet .
but you did, so thanks .
Your post insightfully suggests that focusing on the directly contrasting positive qualities of your own party is an essential element of doing so.
(which is why the US didn't sign, and rightly so)
The Onion came up with a quite efficient way to make George Bush sign the Kyoto protocol.
Faced with this clear and entirely sensible expression of united will on the part of all parties in the Senate, combined with the rickety and uncertain scientific case for global panic , why should George Bush have diverted federal energies and funds towards the chimera of " climate change " with any sense of urgency, or in any greater amounts than those which his administration has already so generously spent ?
I think business needs to evolve its thinking with respect to natural (and human resources).
The Onion has a great story today titled, "Bush Told to Sign Birthday Treaty for Someone Named Kyoto."
It is tempting to say the mere fact that the US President felt it necessary to deliver a speech on climate change and to announce new goals related to climate change could be seen as a step forward .
I share these concerns, and I believe they can be sensibly reconciled .
Over the past seven years, my administration has taken a rational , balanced approach to these serious challenges.
We believe we need to protect our environment.
We believe we need to strengthen our energy security.
We believe we need to grow our economy.
And we believe the only way to achieve these goals is through continued advances in technology.
I ' m pleased to say that we remain on track to meet this goal even as our economy has grown 17 percent.
Countries like China and India are experiencing rapid economic growth ' and that 's good for their people and it's good for the world.
The environmental community needs to make an equal change to its thoughts and ways, and start looking at problems with an eye for finance.
In support of this process, and based on technology advances and strong new policy, it is now time for the U.S. to look beyond 2012 and to take the next step.
We've laid a solid foundation for further progress.
But these measures ' while these measures will bring us a long way to achieving our new goal, we 've got to do more in the power generation sector.
Such decisions should be opened ' debated openly;
The right way is to promote more emission-free nuclear power and encourage the investments necessary to produce electricity from coal without releasing carbon into the air.
The right way is to ensure that all major economies are bound to take action and to work cooperatively with our partners for a fair and effective international climate agreement.
The right way is to work to make advanced technology affordable and available in the developing world ' by lowering trade barriers, creating a global free market for clean energy technologies, and enhancing international cooperation and technology investment.
The next step in the major economies process is a meeting this week in Paris ' and I want to thank my friend, President Sarkozy, for hosting it.
I 'm confident that with sensible and balanced policies from Washington, American innovators and entrepreneurs will pioneer a new generation of technology that improves our environment, strengthens our economy, and continues to amaze the world.
We have the potential to move toward energy independence by producing ethanol and biodiesel for transportation, but the entrepreneur, not the bureaucrat, must realize this change.
We need to get management accountants to consider the environment.
We need more consumer demand and new policies that don't hand so much to oil companies.
"...but the entrepreneur, not the bureaucrat, must realize this change."
The masses are waiting for some type of Green God to lead them to salvation from global warming, someone to tell them how their tax dollars are going to keep the Earth's temperature from rising.
We want someone else to take charge--to fix the problem.
the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal .

this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . 
it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .

it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn . 
if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested . 
human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 
to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
sturdy , entertaining period drama . . . both caine and fraser have their moments . 
whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
 . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox's work . 
on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids . 
jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
warm and exotic .

once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
a loving little film of considerable appeal . 
the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .

flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 
no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
a warm , funny , engaging film . 
uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film
entertains by providing good , lively company . 
dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners .

as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
[lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
whether you like rap music or loathe it , you can't deny either the tragic loss of two young men in the prime of their talent or the power of this movie . 
 . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
a deep and meaningful film . 
the film's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip . 
it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip .

a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth .

a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors . 
the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
[t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
you won't like roger , but you will quickly recognize him . and that's a big part of why we go to the movies .

a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 
a smart , witty follow-up . 
while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise .

chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer .

what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
 . . . a true delight . 
without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun .

it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love .

ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a exist�ncia de papai noel era um fato inquestion�vel . 
it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books .

hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '
an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda .

people cinema at its finest . 
the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
 . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs � sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
a true pleasure . 
lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results .

a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation .

they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is .

brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . .

an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st . petersburg's hermitage museum . 
[hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul . 
an epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood . 
genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love . 
lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman . 
in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clich�s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
 " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind . 
interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises . 
this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing . 
never once predictable . 
biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . 
after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
 . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
without resorting to hyperbole , i can state that kissing jessica stein may be the best same-sex romance i have seen . 
nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
a potent allegorical love story . 
even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . 
the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife . 
a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance . 
the movie isn't always easy to look at . but if it is indeed a duty of art to reflect life , than leigh has created a masterful piece of artistry right here . 
it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
[howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing . 
it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius . 
I love my nokia 3310 !
I will keep this phone for as long as it lives and then go straight out and buy the same one !
The sound is good
The status option is very very useful (it tells you how much time you have left on the battery), and the GPRS is good.
This phone is excellent value , sleek and light, with really great features.
Comes highly recommended for anyone who wants a phone, full stop.
The T68i is a great phone that has superb looks .
I'm very pleased with this phone, people still buy it now even though it's quite old.
This phone's easy to use (to me anyway), stylish , packed with features and has a colour screen.
Overall i'm very pleased with this phone and recomend it to anyone, but if you want the very lastest phone with everything, i recommend a different phone like the Z600 as the T68i is quite old.
Nokia have managed to achieve three things extremely well , which most mobiles at best only achieve one.
That is a stunning piece of styling , excellent functionality , and outstanding ruggedness .
As a simple 'phone, have had no 'software' problems or glitches as you might get on more sophisticated handsets.
The way the phone telescopes out is a joy to watch , you will end up continually open and closing the phone just to watch it.
The casing being titanium it's extremely strong and lightweight .
In short the best phone I've ever owned .
do what all the new mobiles do but it looks good and people still look at it when you answer calls.
The best phone that nokia have done up to now.
Ease of use, STANDARD NOKIA MENUS WITH NOW A HELPFUL MESSAGE COUNTER TO KEEP TRACK !
Value for money if you have many sims as i do.
I loved the look of the phone, its 'unbreakable' characteristic was very appealing .
things seemed to be better after that and i was please with it.
This is the ideal phone for anybody active, it's unbreakable .
If you're of a certain age and find you have to use reading glasses most of the time you'll be grateful for the large , chunky , monochrome menus and text size on this phone.
All in all, a good phone to have for someone likely to drop it often and people who are active.
great clock screensaver
excellent calender feature.
infra red ok
good size and i like the masculine look.
TOP PHONE !!!!!!
i have had this phone and found the features amazing also the rubber case makes this phone more durable
The mobile itself is ok but not what you would expect for the price.
The sharp gx10 is an amazing phone with couler screen and a built in digital camera my brother has one and i am loking to purchase one.
This is an excellent phone .
I've been using a modern non-Nokia colour-screen mobile alongside this phone for some weeks now, and I find that the old Nokia's monochrome screen - which uses reflected light rather than a backlight - is actually much, much easier to read in daylight than the modern phone's.
Colour screen, polyphonic ringtones and picture messaging all for a great price .
Furthermore the 3510i features 35 preloaded ringtones, polyphonic and monophonic which are all great .
However, bare in mind this phone was first released a good few years ago when colour phones were the height of technology, and it suddenly doesn't seem so bad
This phone is reliable and sturdy .
The battery life is good .
If this is all you need , why don't you get it ?
But, 9 times out of 10, if you drop it, it won't break .
Let's face it, you dont get all those features on your landline phone, but then you dont need them.
this phone is brilliant , it has polyphonic ringtones, java games and is sleek and really cool .
the phone is an excellent price and is easy to set up and use.
Furthermore, the display can stay on all the time because it doesn't need a backlight to render it visible, so you can just glance at the phone anytime to see whether you have a signal, battery energy, messages or missed calls without having to push buttons to make the screen come on.
the games are cool , my fave is skydiver where you get certain amounts of points for diving through rings and then landing on a certain part of the square.
the phone sounds and features are great and the ringtones are even better .
a superb phone , buy it now !!!
This phone is lightweight sleek and stylish @ a very affordable price , ideal for anybody.
Thumbs up to the Nokia 3510i
wicked just plain wicked , best price for peole with not alot of money and the needs for a good fone
This phone is like no other it has it's own idependience !!!
thats all i can say !
It has got mono display (yoy can see everything in the sun) with improved resolution (comparing to nokia 3310), very comfortable large buuttons, It has got 5 games (SNAKE 2, LInk 5, SPACE IMPACT, BUMPER and BANTUMI).
In the menu EXTRAS You can find: alarm clock ( wow-incredible ),calculator, stopwatch, countdown timer, composer, picture editor, screen saver.
Furthermore, the beepy ringtones and SMS alerts are much louder and more piercing (when turned up to the highest level) than they are on most modern phones - this is important for me, because I'm a bit on the deaf side.
Mono ringtons sounds well especially that one called FUNFAIR, HUMMINGBIRD or TRANSYLVANIA.
You can hear them clearly in the crowd, bus etc.
For me it is improvement comparing to the previous model.
Phone is quite heavy (which is good for me), screen is settled deep in the case so there is no way you can damage it .
Being a black and white phone and having few functions gives it extended battery life and makes it a good phone for taking on holiday where you do not need all the add ons of your normal phone and due to the low cost if you lose this it is not the end of the world.
I would also recommend this as a first phone due to it being very easy to use and does not have anything that confuse a less electronically minded person.
We had a problem with the first phone but I got in touch straight away and was very happy that the matter was dealt with very promptly and fairly.
very pleased with phone.
When I first got this phone. I was pleased with my choice.
It looked cool and it was even cooler when I switched it on.
I miss calls and messages on the modern phone all the time - it just won't go loud enough .
This phone was purchased for my father in law for fathers day the phone was as described excellent delivery from seller the phone is an older model but for my father in law it was ideal as he has large fingers and is easy to select buttons for using the phone the phone itself is easy to use as with most nokia phones would recomend for someone looking for an easy phone to use and control it doesn't have a camera or a music player but is still a good phone .
First impressions of the Nokia 5100, for me, was that it was a bit ugly, but this phone has grown and grown on me and I love it.
I bought the data cable which has opened up another world to the 5100.
This has proven to be the very best mobile phone I have ever owned.
The battery life is amazing , - it seems to go on for ever between rechargings.
It's strong and durable and the shape and size of the phone are sensible and comfortable to hold.
The keys are well spaced and of a decent size for the average finger.
Reception has been excellent home and abroad.
Basically I think it is and does all that a mobile phone should be and do , without all the superfluous gizmos of the latest market trends.
Having carried my 6310 every day for 5 months now in some very demanding conditions, I am impressed with the quality of build as well as exceptional quality of reception and transmission.
In short - a Nokia design classic, still worth owning .
It took all the knocks and bumps without protest and survived and operated faultlessly in temperatures from minus 10 Centigrade to plus 65 centigrade in desert conditions.
The keys are a decent and useable size for calls & texting, the speaker quality for listening is better than any other mobile I've heard to date and the phone's battery life for stand-by and talk-time is excellent .
The phone is well weighted and comfortable to hold and follows the contours of my face well which makes long calls a fairly pleasant experience .
I've owned a Motorola V3i &a Sony K800i but I still really enjoy using this one.
It obviously hasn't got an exciting ring-tone quality, a camera or an MP3 player but if you want an excellent practical and reliable working phone, I highly recommend this one.
I got this phone second hand some years ago and it has been excellent .
I was thinking of buying another phone, but ithas held its value remarkably , hardly surprising I guess.
A sturdy build, its reliable and simply one of the best phones on the market
Can't recommend it enough !
the 6310i mobile phone is a great phone , i have had a few of them down through the years, but this one that i bought im afraid was nothing more then a knock off.
The Nokia 3330 has been my wife's GSM for quite a number of years, and although she has just got a new phone it is worth being witness to the quality of this phone.
If you don't need a camera phone and only make calls and send texts, forget the latest technology, buy a Nokia 6310i !
The 6310i was the best mobile I have ever owned and it worked perfectly in the UK, Europe and US for over 4 years, until I dropped it in water.
The 6310i is the king of mobiles - after this all anyone did was to add silly extras like cameras, radios and other nonsense...
The Nokia 6310i is the best phone that I have ever owned .
I don't think there is another phone available in the UK or the world that can meet the quality and easy of use as this phone.
Even after 5 years of improved technology this phone is still top and is regarded by business as the best phone made .
I believe that other sellers products are genuine but Go Buy 2000 supplied a so-called brand new product to me in a re-sealable plastic bag !
After countless 'upgrades' I've now gone back to using this phone full-time as it's way, way better than anything else out there .
This is a ' proper ' phone - it just 'works', it's totally bullet-proof , the battery life is unreal , and it doesn't pretend to be anything else - no camera, no music, no games to speak of! It also looks pretty cool in a weird way!
This is the way forward - go retro !
The key strengths of this phone were its robustness and simplicity .
Best phone for durability.
Battery life superb .
Needless to say its appearance is now less than perfect yet on it goes, reliable as ever.

Needless to say its appearance is now less than perfect yet on it goes, reliable as ever.
It has everything you need - you can phone people, and text them, and play snake II (which is soooo addictive ... ) ... what more do you need from a phone ?
By today's standards it was primitive, but the new phones have more complicated interfaces and I'm not convinced they will last as long as the old 3330 workhorse.
Another good point was that it had an easy to use and very robust keyboard (with big keys), and a simple easy to master display and interface.
Also even some years ago it was a cheep choice .
So top marks to Nokia.
Compact and easy to use .
Even now, it's only because the charger broke, the phone itself is fine still .
Really robust , been chucked around in bags, had a French horn fall on it, a close encounter wth a set of keys, and it's STILL completely in one piece , no cracks or anything.
True, it's not in any way as up to date as other phones out there - there's no colour, no camera, no MP3, but it does have WAP capabilities, and all the basics, as well as incredibly long battery life.
Fantastic phone, if you want a basic mobile without too mnay bells and whistles , this is the one
I can't recommend it enough .
It has loads of ringtones contained in it, and you can download/input more, or you can have it on vibrate if you don't want it to make a noise.
This is phone is a strage upgrade, a follow up to the 3330 yet offering most of the features of the 8310, including online gaming and JAVA technologies.
Its also a very easy phone to use and has an outstandingly long battery life of almost 2 weeks at standby - Ive kept old of this model even when the models such as the new-fangled 7210 have hit the market, and let me tell you I dont regret it .
If you want an outstanding quality phone at a budget: by this phone today !
The Nokia 3410 remains my favourite .
Robust , long battery life , and easy to find spares for the case and keypad.
You can drop it onto a hard floor and it just keeps on working .
Its microphone and speaker are a lot better than on many much newer phones - voice quality is excellent , and mike sensitivity is high .
No fiddly little keys , and a simple menu structure makes it easy to use .
Mine will probably outlast most new phones.
After six years ... why change ?
You can change the covers, both front and back, and there are hundreds of covers to choose from so it's easy to personalise.
Postives
The T68i was my choice, and it was quite a good one .
Before I had the Sony Ericsson T68i, I was stuck with my old Nokia 3310.
I love it !
It's the best phone I've ever had.
The colour screen is clear , even in sunlight, and you can fiddle around with the contrast and backlight settings.
The keypad is blue when illuminated and looks very cool indeed.
Bluetooth is a really good thing for Sony Ericsson to include, although the phone does lack a camera.
The T68i was my choice, and it was quite a good one.
This phis the greatest of all time , it has all the features, polyphonic ringtones gprs, colour screen, games, optional camera and many many more all for this great price .
I still use it now and never get bored with it as you can always change the cover, ringtones and screensavers.
A great deal , a steal at this price.
this phone is a little gem .
as a first buy for a mobile phone you will not find a better one and a low price aswell.
its a very stylish and small and very similar to other flip phones on the market but at a way way cheaper price its flip conceals the keypad so there is no problem of ever phoneing someone without realising its in your pocket ringing the ringtones are ok i suppose but being able to download them helps to personalise them to your tastes.
I have dropped it, mistreated it, and it is still working .
Easy to use as basic phone - easy to carry , answer and make calls
Good battery life ( 2-3 days under constant use).
Overall, I have not been disappointed .
The phone features are very good , the multimedia functions are excellent (video clips of the Matrix Reloaded anyone?) and the PDA facilities are brilliant
it synchronises like a dream with my PC.
It has very up to date features even though it is quite old such as WAP.
but I am glad I did.
Top marks Sony Ericsson!
What will this phone not do ?
I am stunned by the number of things this phone can do.
The display is stunning , watching videos is unbelievable and the sound awesome !
Recommend this to anyone.
Still stunned by what it can do, don't miss predictive text as handwriting recognition is stunning .
Need the latest firmware update (R2F) to get additional features but worth it .
Still recommended although whether the imminent release of the P900 will change views I don't know.
This is a great tool .
I have not found a fault with this phone and would recommend it to anyone of any age
Wow what a really fantastic phone , packed full of features and the software is really good .
I especially like being able to get software for my P800 like Traffic-i just makes the phone so useful .
This smartphone is the single greatest achievment since the invention of the mobile phone.
It can perform many tasks through its very easy to use menu system.
The MEMORY STICK DUO supplied with the phone is the perfect addition at 16MB its good for starters although 128MB versions are now hitting the streets and these prove to be very handy for storing VIDEOS (MP4)to be watched at any time.
All in all this phone is a must buy .
Buy Yours TODAY.
You wont be sorry .
This PDA/Phone is a good buy , it's a couple of years old but for the hectic lifestyles we live it is ideal .
My new Nokia seems to be a far superior product .
The battery life is good and in 2 and a half years I still haven't had to buy a new one.
The T68i has many useful features for the IT centered user.
I would rate this phone as the best in terms of connectivity.
Not only can the phonebook and the calendar in the handset can be easily synchronised with Microsoft Outlook through infrared or bluetooth
I transferred my phone book with about 100 entries from my PC to the handset in minutes !
It's the perfect match if you want to be online from your laptop.
I have now owned this phone for a couple of months and am very pleased with its performances.
I have just got this phone and I am really pleased with it.
Also I like the size, my other phone felt like a brick compared to this.
Recommended to one and all.
Considering this phone is quite old by comparison to what's now on the market, it was way ahead of its time when first released.
Well done Nokia !
I got my t68 a few months ago, and my oh my , it is good !
The screen is clear and the backlight is very bright in the dark.
Cameras, radios, mp3 players, bluetooth headsets, etc, all available for the phone, all-in-all, making it a very upgradeable phone.
It does creak a little when pressing the buttons, but it is very nice to work with.
The joystick is a little hard to get used to, but with use, it becomes a joy to use.
Erix (a jezzball clone) is very addictive and enjoyable with the joystick.
The T68 looks very cute and it is very light .
The jog-dial on the side is rarely used on my phone, but like bluetooth, some people will find it very useful .
The screen is great .
256 colours and a resolution of 101x80, it is very easy to find logos on the internet, and free if you get an infrared adapter, bluetooth adapter or data cable for your PC.

Once this mess at the top is sorted out, I retain much hope that a recovery can begin.
China's growth appears to be an accepted fact, with no attempt to address the rise from the West.
Somehow, it will all come right in the end.....
But once the current government are gone, and a few dramatic events shock the new government into reality, the UK will surprise you with its ability to adapt, overcome and prosper.
I think God had a hand in getting Obama elected so he could save the economies of the west.
The Chinese couple you mentioned, they're everywhere.
There are definitely a lot of people putting their time in the West, but the difference is that there's too much 'dead weight' (economically speaking) dragging their efforts down.
China is growing extremely fast, even during this global downturn.
The US has a super economy because if its culture.
It is extremely dynamic, open and the culture is that you must make it for yourself.
America always recovers because it is the most capitalist country, making its currency very resilient.
There are many reasons to be optimistic.
Right now in America, entrepreneurs are rubbing their hands together knowing that this latest bout of Creative Destruction could place them at the forefront, and they will still be doing business in dollars.
I don't think Chinese leaders have a choice: China has to emerge victorious from this crisis.
The world doesn't need the West's lazy, expensive and resentful workers, and soon it won't need many of its Chinese and Indian cheap and hard-working ones either.
I think its obvious that the 21st century is their time again to show the world what they are capable of and I think its a case of "you aint seen nothing yet"
So we have a situation where the countries allow access to their internal markets and allow free trade and the Chinese use this to have a surging economy based on exports whlst also making it very difficult for foreign companies to reciprocate and buy into Chinese industries or allow imports.
Then ultimately China wins and the rest of us lose.
Now THAT is worrying considering the Chinese launch new policys through such channels.
You are living proof that we can do exactly that, Chas.
I would not usually post a link to an emotive report on the blog, but it gives a flavour of some of the simmering anger that threatens stability.
A belief that the same regulators who set up the current system, with terrible results, will be able to regulate against another crisis
This is a sign the credit crunch is ending.
I just wanted to add that I am extremely optimistic that the current recession will end within the next 12 months, mainly because of G20 and the stead-fast and resolute determination of governments do take whatever step is necessary to avoid the collapse of banks.
The answer to Lemming's question, and perhaps the questions of others, is that there is no basic problem in economic growth, and no real problem in a system built around consumption.
The benefit of capitalism is the provision of goods and services to meet the needs and wants of individuals, and it has consistently delivered on that promise, and provided the many innovations that arise from such a system that benefit us in a myriad of ways.
I agree that capitalism is an excellent way to provide goods and services.
I've always thought capitalism was an excellent model when markets work permanently.
In the meantime China is now in a position where it is flexing its economic muscles with impunity.
Their blocking of the Coca Cola purchase of a Chinese drinks company is an example of their new found power.
So in reality the central bank created money which stays in the country is a better way of making an investment!
If more tourists demand large amounts of euros, then eventually the central bank will create more.
Everyone in the media right now seems to be pointing their fingers at the bankers with their high bonus and short term risk taking strategies and essentially saying "you crashed the economy"!
I am confident that the credit crunch will end soon.
I really don't think that is true, I think they were in part to blame but there were underlying problems which would have surfaced anyway.
I'm so glad we know better in the West.
If they dont like all the attention, cancel the show!
Also, how can you complain about someone following you around taking your picture when you get PAID to have video cameras follow you around and film you?
I dont give a ratshit about how sad they are about the poporizzis.
I would love to see someone just take a pair of scissors and chop that hanging part off.
That's some nice bling... her new song is actually pretty good
She is a crackie, nice hand pose culito
J-Lo will always be sexy, she just aint all that no more.
Gee, Sandy, a little bitter?
But regarding the credit crunch, there is reason to be optimistic.
Why should she feed children in Africa?
She can donate money to Puerto Rico if she wants to. Or not.
It's her money;
she worked for it, and she doesn't have to give it to anyone.
J LO is still undeniably hot! Her singing and acting may not be the best, but she's a beautiful diva nonetheless!!!
Humans are innately Lazy, Greedy and self-centred (with "self" being extended to include loved ones etc).
I don't believe this for one second.
If all humans were in fact inherently lazy, then why doesn't everyone (or even 50% of the work force) quit work tomorrow and go and claim welfare?
These people have no real desire to make the world a better place.
The Chinese economy may, or may not be, at a point where internal growth within China has the potential to take up the slack.
The good outcome is slow growth, maybe with the odd quarter of slight contraction.
However, the major question mark over the future of China has remained, and my posts have tried to balance the potential for huge economic success with the risks to the Chinese economy from the world economic crisis.
As China's importance in the world economy has become ever more apparent, there has been growing interest in the state of the Chinese economy.
Within the speculation, I suggested that China would discreetly start to dump treasuries, and would move their reserves into a broad based portfolio of assets.
However, it is now apparent that China has made significant moves towards gold, and this was one of the moves that I suggested in the post.
Above all, such a policy safeguards China's industrial revolution, while the West may one day face a supply crisis.
It could well be that China is returning to its traditional position as the preeminent country in the world.
There is quite simply not enough gold around as to be able to diversify into that at a large scale. However they may be able to get their hands on the IMF reserves.
China's economy has been doing extremely well for the last three decades and at every step some people were screaming for a collapse that never came, even though the commercial real estate market looks oversized and there seem to be export overcapacities, anything else seems to be going fine.
However China it seems this time in history wish to be involved in the global economy and become the next superpower.
Gold and copper acquisitions are only the tip of the iceberg.
The USA and Britain have been at the forefront of this process of destruction of the "welfare state" (and New Deal in the US), and perhaps the current financial collapse will cause a re-think of the direction we are taking, and generate enough political momentum to change things.
He does not consider that China might spread their reserves over a wide range of assets, and this is my best guess for the direction of China's policy.
In other words, they are on the path to success.

Given the ECB's inflation target of ``below 2 percent,'' which can be interpreted as a range of 0 percent to 2 percent, most economists reckon that interest rates in the euro area are about right.
``There must be a route map so that it's perfectly feasible to have a referendum before the election,'' said Graham Bishop, a pro-euro economic consultant, reflecting a sense in the pro-euro camp that some kind of compromise will be found to keep alive the campaign for the euro.
But pro-euro campaigners said the disparity in interest rates proved exactly why Britain sioqld join the euro in order to take the uncertainty out of the poen$/s exchange rate with the euro, which is now at record high levels against the British currency.
Now that the pound has fallen, exporters are happier.
Hungary's high rates are necessary to prevent runaway inflation, Bod said.
Estonia, with low inflation and almost no debt, has made "amazing" progress, according to Issing.
The recent wage agreements negotiated by German companies like Siemens and Volkswagen made German industry more competitive, Mayer said.
"Everything was cheaper during the days of the Deutsche mark."
Twenty miles north of here is Klatovy, a town with a handsome main square that used to be filled with cars bearing German license plates.
"The first years were the best for us," said Martin Sauer, the owner of an optical shop, referring to the period after 1989, when the Iron Curtain fell.
Among other casualties of France's rejection may be the further expansion of the European Union, a process economists often advocate as a way to spur Europe's growth and competitiveness.
The euro's recent decline versus the dollar, he added, was not a bad thing since it would help European exporters regain their edge in foreign markets.
A poll taken late last month by the Forsa organization for Stern magazine found 56 percent of Germans preferred to return to the mark.
Meanwhile, a poll by the German weekly Stern shows that a majority of Germans want to move back to the German mark.
From an economic perspective, a unified currency makes eminent sense for the 12 nations that have adopted it.
"Everywhere I go, I find support," Maroni said.
Has Britain suffered from sticking with sterling?"
But the euro should be seen as a productive constraint obliging the development of a high-tech service sector and forcing family firms to innovate."
Though she is a true pioneer, Dr. Sally K.Ride, the first American woman in space, strode into a hotel lobby here this month and went unnoticed.
Her organization, Imaginary Lines in San Diego, organizes science fairs for girls, workshops for teachers and vacation camps where girls learn, as Ride says, ``that science is really cool.''
We're hoping that in the future there might be an independent technical organization within NASA with its own resources that will give engineers a venue to help them develop data for their arguments.
With human space flight, you'd better add the word ``safety'' in there, too, because if upper management is going ``faster, better, cheaper,'' that percolates down, and it puts the emphasis on meeting schedules and improving the way that you do things and on cost.
The answer is a qualified yes.
That's a very good record for a launch vehicle.
I like the shuttle.
We set it up as a business because we thought it was a better way to have an impact quickly.
But this is something I'm very willing to put my name behind.
However, he said, the agency has made real progress toward flying again.
"It's been a hard year, but we've made significant progress in getting this vehicle ready for return to flight," said William Parsons, space shuttle program manager.
"In terms of following our recommendations, NASA has if anything raised the bar higher than we set it," Logsdon said in an interview.
NASA officials said on Thursday that the agency had come a long way in reforming itself, but realized it had more work to do.
People at lower levels are also indicating that they are getting more comfortable communicating with their superiors, he said.
Readdy said that engineers had made great progress in changing the way foam is applied to the fuel tank, and how the work is inspected.
The agency's administrator, Sean O'Keefe, repeatedly vowed that NASA would, as he put it in June 2003, "comply fully without any equivocation" with the board's recommendations.
The head of the accident investigation board supports the agency's view, as does a special panel formed by NASA to monitor the agency's progress in meeting the recommendations.
"I give them a passing grade, over all," he said in an interview, adding that the board's goal was "breaking the chain" of problems that led to foam falling off the fuel tank and striking Columbia.
In a briefing last month with reporters, Col.Eileen M.Collins of the Air Force, the commander for the coming shuttle flight, said simply, "If it wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it."
Nonetheless, the task group credited the space agency with making significant strides since the Columbia tragedy, noting that NASA had satisfied 12 of the 15 findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.
"Given the level of complexity of the issues involved, I would certainly expect to hear, and I welcome, different points of view," Griffin said in a statement.
"While we can say in our opinion NASA has not met the (Columbia Accident Investigation Board's) intent, we are saying they have made significant progress.
"Based on a very thorough and very successful flight readiness review, we are currently 'go for launch' of Discovery on July 13," said Dr.Michael D.Griffin, the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
At a news conference punctuated by the rolling thunder of a summer downpour of the kind that could well cause launching delays, Griffin and other NASA officials expressed ebullient confidence in their agency and their craft.
By eliminating many sources of risk, NASA officials say, the agency has made the remaining shuttle fleet safer than ever.
He added: "We honestly believe this is the cleanest flight we have ever done.
Griffin said he was delighted with the task group's report, which he said simply acknowledged how difficult the challenges were.
"We are being as smart about this as we know how to be, but we are up against the limits of our human knowledge," he said.
John M.Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of the accident investigation board, called the planned launching "an absolutely essential step to creating forward momentum" for the space program.
While gleeful about the 10:39 a.m. launch, NASA officials were noticeably cautious, saying they will not know for several days whether enormous efforts to protect Discovery from the problems that doomed Columbia were successful - and would not celebrate until the vehicle safely lands in the early morning hours of Aug. 7.
The advisory group also said there was no plan for an in-flight repair - but members still said the shuttle should fly.
Almost three hours after takeoff, flight commander Eileen Collins, 48, radioed mission control that the liftoff was the smoothest of her four flights and thanked shuttle workers for their "super work."
"It's an important day for our country," she said.
President Bush watched from his private dining room in the White House, saying "this flight is an essential step toward our goal of continuing to lead the world in space science, human space flight, and space exploration."
"I was crossing my fingers that they were going to make it," said Lisa Steck, 44, a third-grade teacher in Framingham, closing her eyes.
"I think it's fantastic that we just sent someone up again."
It was not just any engineer; it was Rodney Rocha, who struggled unsuccessfully to get NASA to request images of the Columbia from spy satellites to check for damage and who was a central figure in the accident investigation report.
"We've learned a lot about ourselves."
"I think that we happen to be, as an organization, one of the bright spots of what can come out of a tragic accident like Columbia," Roe said in an interview earlier this year.
Referring to the skimpy data during the Columbia mission and the inadequacy of tools to estimate and analyze damage, he said, "The difference between where we were before and where we are now is profound."
During the Discovery mission, armies of engineers used new software and engineering tools that Hale said were "three or four generations more sophisticated" than anything the Columbia team had.
They also had cameras and sensors that detected "every spot, scuff, ding, you name it," which helped them to decide in favor of a spacewalk to pluck two protruding "gap fillers" from the underside of the Discovery.
In an interview, Rocha said he was enjoying the greater role that engineering now plays in meetings.
"Engineering is more independent than ever, more assertive than ever," he said, "and more in your face.
Howard E.McCurdy, a public affairs professor at American University in Washington who has written extensively on NASA, said: "The system has changed.
``I don't believe that America will justifiably make an unprovoked attack on another nation,'' Armey said.
You won't see a fundamental doubt about the rightness of our cause.''
Besides, U.S. military superiority is so overwhelming that ``I can't think of a way we won't be able to fulfill our military goals,'' O'Hanlon said.
``It could be a cakewalk,'' Eland said.
We want peace.''
Shi'a and Sunni Muslims have banded together under the leadership of clerics and are calling for an Islamic state to replace the secular Ba'ath regime.
He also sought to assure a gathering of some supporters and many Western reporters that America's intentions in Iraq were not hostile.
``That is the policy of the United States, that's what President Bush has said, and I believe him.''
Yes to Islamic State'' one protest banner declared.
" Dobbs' group favors an immediate withdrawal from Iraq, a position rejected by Bush and the majority of members of Congress.
He said the milestone will produce anti-war momentum.
But this war is as serious as any war America has fought," May said.
"This is as important as World War II," he said, in which America suffered more than 400,000 military deaths.
"I think their service was honorable.
We think that their service is worth the effort.
And when you talk to the majority of their brothers, the young soldiers out there fighting the fight, they want us to finish this mission," Webster said.
The war in Iraq remains "the central front"in a "global war on terror," Bush insisted, even though ousted dictator Saddam Hussein played no part in the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida attacks on the United States.
"Sen.John Kerry, D-Mass., the defeated 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, called for withdrawal of 20,000 U.S. troops from Iraq by December, with the remainder of the 160,000 U.S. combat troops brought home within a "reasonable time frame."
Airlines have been saying that the filters aboard modern planes do a good job of removing viruses from the air.
Doctors here had also been insisting until Sunday that their treatments for SARS were broadly effective, and they hidqsed this as an incentive for people to enter hospitals when they felt sick.
He said the jump might also reflect more effective or honest reporting from Taiyuan after central authorities sent a special team there last week to strengthen the effort against SARS.
The international experts, based on their limited work, say they are impressed by Beijing's careful care of patients in specially designated hospitals, and its strengthened efforts to trace and isolate those who have been in close contact with SARS patients.
And health officials are being particularly diligent in monitoring for the disease in offices in Asian neighborhoods, Romney says.
Herbal medicines, Chinesm Madicine proponents say, help boost the body's immune system, which they say can then better fight off the coronavirus that researchers say causes SARS.
It has confidence in its pronouncements, Stoehr said, because it has placed international teams of experts in affected areas to monitor how well local health officials are keeping track of SARS and controlling its spread.
``China used to do a very good job with very little money,'' said Jing Jun, a professor of sociology at Tsinghua University.
``Tracking people, monitoring people, controlling people _ they can do that better than anyone.
One group, from the United States and Canada, said that early detection and isolation of cases, along with quarantine of suspected cases, could significantly slow the spread of SARS.
Burke said that there is no definitive evidence to prove that the virus will return, but that surveillance must be conducted to make sure no stone is left un-turned.
``If we believe in preemptive action, this is as compelling a case for it as I know.''
Both Burke and Grant stressed a need for improved testing procedures.
Grant emphasized the importance of cooperation between different sectors of the community in general.
Grant said the travel industry had been extraordinarily helpful in isolating travelers that the CDC had pinpointed as potential public health risks because of their exposure to SARS.
Traffic agents gamely tried to keep people and machines separated.
On the other hand, some said the blackout, which interrupted production at automobile factories around Detroit, might trim excessive inventories that have been filling dealers' lots.
``New Yorkers showed that the city that burned in the 1970s when facing similar circumstances is now a very different place,'' Bloomberg said.
Bloomberg said Con Edison had ``done as good a job as could be hoped for.
``Technology exists to prevent this type of cascading,'' said McGreevey, calling for ``a thorough, complete, agonizing'' investigation not only ``into what happened, but more importantly, what are we going to do to prevent this from happening again.''
But Cambridge Energy said on Friday that it had access to a more complete set of data and other information and that it believed its scenario was the most thorough yet to emerge.
Stauffer, the Cambridge Energy researcher, said of the theory, ``I think this one is supported by the facts.
And several officials from industry groups charged with preventing blackouts in various regions around the grid said that the analysis did seem consistent with information they had collected so far.
American Electric Power's safety systems isolated the trouble spot, as designed.
The old system was better able to ensure a stable electricity supply because it was easier for government to regulate, said David Hughes, executive director of Citizen Power, a Pennsylvania-based consumer group.
Bryan Lee, a spokesman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission _ which oversees electricity at the federal level _ disputed flatly that deregulation was a factor in the blackout.
Owen said it is a myth, however, that utilities have entirely neglected transmission lines.
Ashley Brown, executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, said it is wrong to blame the blackout on deregulation.
Another witness, Elizabeth A.Moler, executive vice president of Exelon, which operates Commonweath Edison and the Philadelphia Electric Co., said, however, that changes were needed to prevent future blackouts.
``Arcane, need I say geeky issues, like congestion management and generation redispatch, really matter, and affect reliability,'' she said.
The utilities industry is doing all it can do on its own, said Jim Owen, spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based association of investor-owned power companies.
The way to avert the darkness is spending billions to make the electricity system redundant, he said.
Engineers, government officials and executives said at the meeting that amid its restructuring the industry needed further changes, to reduce the frequency of blackouts as utilities that formerly generated power, transmitted it and delivered it are broken up into separate entities of competing businesses.
He also said that while the old utilities had often maintained large reserve margins of electricity, to minimize the chance of shortages, some market participants now preferred lower margins, to drive up prices.
In a paper written for the meeting, Dave Goulding, chief executive of the Ontario Independent Electricity System Operator, said that "competition leads to trade and greater interconnectedness," which could boost reliability.
In the taped conversations, Ahmed calls himself "the thread behind the Madrid plot," discusses an imminent terrorist operation in an unidentified location and the deployment of suicide martyrs to Iraq, and complains about his marriage and money problems.
He boasts that while the Americans possess nuclear weapons, he has seen "something in the form of a hair dryer" that causes "the most horrible death possible" by suffocation.
From the point of view of the Italians, their handling of the case -- from the discovery and monitoring of Ahmed to a flood of information they passed on to Spanish investigators even before his arrest -- is evidence of first-rate police work and bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
The Italians are confident that the conversations can provide the basis of a case against Ahmed in Italy.
"We have been lucky that our investigations have managed to abort other plots before acts of terrorism took place," Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar, the justice minister, said in an interview.
"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful America," said Bush, 58, a former governor of Texas who has battled a troubled domestic economy and waged wars in Afghanistan and Iraq during 43 months in office.
Bush said he was running with a "compassionate conservative philosophy" that calls for the federal government to "help people improve their lives_not try to run their lives."
"We are making progress and there is more to do," Bush said.
"I believe this nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership_and that is why, with your help, we will win this election," Bush said, with his parents, former President George Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush, looking on.
"This young century will be liberty's century,"Bush promised.
"I have seen courage and consistency_the courage to stand up to terrorists and the consistency to beat them," said Franks.
Bush's progress on the economy "doesn't always get the spotlight or the newspaper headlines," Card claimed.
Bennett called it "a textbook campaign, with everyone pulling together -- national, state and local -- maybe the best I've been involved in."
But he also said the Democrats and their allies were matching the Republicans move for, if not quite with the same level of unity.
"It really gives them personality," said Shep Murray, one of two brothers who started Vineyard Vines, often found by politicians vacationing on Martha's Vineyard.
"He likes the Hermes tie.
When Kerry needs a chief executive look, he favors dark, two-button classics made by Southwick Clothing near Boston -- as he did during the Democratic convention.
Bush prefers the handmade look of Oxxford Clothes in Chicago.
He wore a pink tie in the primaries, and that helped.
It softens him up."
Personal appearance was among the reasons why Richard Nixon lost to John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, said Charmaine McClarie, whose boutique firm helps executives with image management.
Kerry fancies form-fitting windsurfing or bicycle pants: Lance Armstrong with a Secret Service detail.
Clothes matched his message, supporters said.
"It brings it down to where you think he's on your level.
"He got right down with the people," said the 52-year-old Carr, the wife of a mine worker.
"George Bush thinks it's important to make those tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 a year permanent," Kerry said.
"I think it's important to roll that back to where it was under Bill Clinton and invest in health care, education, lowering the cost of college.
Bush was scheduled to address proposed changes to limit medical malpractice liability at the event in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., but instead will deliver a "significant speech" on terrorism and the economy, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
Bush's supporters believe in him too much for that.
That is not to say that Bush's supporters do not enjoy the fanfare around his visits, which are ticketed events overseen by local Republican officials.
But as some of the participants described it, the rallies have also become moments of calm reassurance -- even a sense of renewal -- in an election contest that can seem anything but calm and reassuring.
"We are here for him," said Janet Pavlik, who endured three hours of traffic and security checks before seeing the president at a farm in Bucks County, Pa.
This is to show our support, for him to see our support, for everyone to see our support."
"He is not going to convince anyone today, but for me personally it is important to be here."
People who know him well describe a steely resolve.
He suggests the same himself on the campaign trail, promising on Friday in Manchester, N.H., "to never cut and run."
Edmund Eisnaugle, a physician from Niles, Ohio, who attended a Bush rally at an airport in nearby Vienna, said he appreciated the president's plain approach.
"He has softened his tone a lot and gotten a lot more personal," Eisnaugle said of the president.
We are in a crisis in this country, and I really sense George Bush is the man who can bring us together."
"He gets it," Rove said of the president.
"There's just something refreshing about giving it your all and then saying the people will make the right decision," Bush told reporters after casting his ballot.
"The hour is late and time is short," said Stevens, appointed in 1975 by President Gerald Ford, adding that he had "faith" that election officials "will enable qualified voters to cast their ballots."
"You know," he said outside his polling place in Crawford, Texas, "there's just something refreshing about giving it your all and then saying the people will make the right decision.
And I believe I'm going to win."
"There are very troubling times, and I believe a president must lead by being resolute and firm and strong and clear," he said.
That's why I'm comfortable about this election."
"We're revved up and this gives us an extra push," volunteer Melissa Sharp said of the presidential drop-by.
"I'm proud to have your support.
The day, to that point, was a success, he said.
The show, according to White House spokesman Scott McClellan, "was a lot of fun."
"We had a long night -- and a great night," Bush said.
"The voters turned out in record numbers and delivered an historic victory."
"We will help the emerging democracies of Iraq and Afghanistan, so they can grow in strength and defend their freedom, and then our servicemen and -women will come home with the honor they have earned," he said.
He said the president had run "forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation's future, and the nation responded by giving him a mandate."
Bush, as he did when he won four years ago, made a point in his victory speech of reaching out to Democrats, saying he wanted to unify a country that had been divided not only by the contest with Kerry, but by the circumstances of Bush's victory four years ago.
"America is in need of unity and longing for a larger measure of compassion," Kerry said.
They ran a very effective campaign and he won.
If Republicans were ecstatic at having won a clean victory without the baggage of 2000, Democrats were bereft at what several described as a rout on Tuesday, and there were immediate signs that the party was facing a dark period of intramural battles.
"But he has an obligation to allow all these votes to be counted."
"It's a chance for him to show what kind of country we are."
Bush and his aides have long argued that the administration's reputation around the world is undeserved, and that he has boosted foreign aid budgets and responded to the AIDS crisis in ways that his more emotive predecessor, Bill Clinton, never did.
And America's response to this tragedy, some administration officials acknowledged, is crucial in places like Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, where the earthquake and tsunami first hit and where Islamic fundamentalism, never a political force during the Cold War, is seeking to make inroads.
Officials of non-governmental organizations say embassies and the Agency for International Development were quick to get help rolling, though they were impeded by the fact that some of the worst-hit areas included the Aceh area of Indonesia, where an anti-government insurgency is under way, and parts of Sri Lanka controlled by the Tamil Tigers.
"I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help," he said of the $35 million that the administration has pledged so far.
No, we're a very generous, kindhearted nation."
Though it was difficult to calculate a dollar figure, the public's response to the disaster has been generous, said Mary E.McClymont, chief executive of InterAction, the largest alliance of U.S.-based private humanitarian agencies.
"The good news is coming in by the hour," Egeland said in New York.
Michael Elmquist, coordinator of the U.N. relief operations in Indonesia, said major progress had been made, both in distributing supplies that had piled up at the regional airports and in evacuating many people who had been left homeless and cut off by the destruction of roads and communications.
Eric Fernando, a spokesman for Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, said that international aid had been abundant, but that there was a pressing need for water-purification equipment.
Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach who has often been characterized as an affable sidekick to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and tax code reform.
Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach who has often been characterized as an affable sidekick to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and tax code reform.
But the pastor - stone-faced and exhausted after many sleepless nights and strenuous days - remains undaunted, carrying on with the faith that from the ashes of disaster, a better future for Aceh will rise.
"Aceh will change because people will see we Christians and foreigners care for them and have condolences."
'I still think God is good'
"In Islam, it is permissible to accept aid from anyone," he said, adding, "It's no problem for outsiders to come here, as long as they respect our customs."
"I still think God is a good God," Rompis said.
"It's been a great success so far," Wolfowitz said of the relief effort, "it's important to sustain it."
Wolfowitz, who recently visited Indonesia, the most populous Islamic country on earth, said the massive U.S. aid has helped this country's image across the Muslim world, where anti-American sentiment has been fueled by the war in Iraq.
"It's had quite an impact, that we were there and ready to help and able to help," said Wolfowitz.
"The politics hung as heavily as the smell of burnt plastic in the air," Black said of his mission.
"It looked like Hiroshima after we dropped the bomb," Black said.
"As far as the eye could see, there was nothing except a carpet of debris several feet deep."
"Leading this training was a life-changing experience," he said.
Hardiman was recommended by SUNY Albany social welfare professor Hal Lawson, who had previously worked in Indonesia.
Hardiman and Black both were struck by the resilience of the tsunami survivors.
Black said he'd return to Banda Aceh to work with tsunami survivors again, given the chance.
"They're amazing people," he said.
They have a remarkable ability to put the loss behind them and move forward."
"Without this information, we can often only guess at what people need," Brown said.
Better information, he said, can save lives and speed the recovery.
"It seems like a natural to me."
Bush's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, defended the president's approach to climate change, saying it ``is not, as some commenters have cynically remarked, to delay action, but to act in a rational and responsible way.''
It would be far better now to adopt "no regrets" policies -- measures that will benefit all of humanity whether global warming turns out to be a problem or not.
"It is clearly a politically significant step in the right direction," Mantua said.
St. Martin said that President Bush "favors an aggressive approach" on the issue of climate change, "one that fosters economic growth that will lead to new technology and innovation."
As Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, a proponent of emissions targets, said in a statement on Nov. 1: "The blunt truth about the politics of climate change is that no country will want to sacrifice its economy in order to meet this challenge."
Enormous investments in basic research have to be made promptly, even with the knowledge that most of the research is likely to fail, if there is to be any chance of creating options for the world's vastly increased energy thirst in a few decades, said Richard G. Richels, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit center for energy and environment research.
"The Japanese government must understand that China is not a weak country now.
"The Chinese government has never done anything for which it has to apologize to the Japanese people," Li said.
"Cadres must resolutely implement the major policies of the central party leadership and resolutely safeguard overall political stability and unity," he said.
On Friday, government officials testily defended the education curriculum.
"Patriotic education is not anti-Japan education," said Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to state media.
The general consensus among terror experts is that the attacks were carried out by a group of "home grown terrorists" from Europe who feel alienated and see radical Islam as a way out of poverty.
"We felt it was appropriate, bearing in mind all the intelligence that we were in possession of," he said.
"We are content that the security system was appropriate, notwithstanding the G-8 summit that was happening in Scotland."
Officials said they were confident that the forensic investigation collected at the four sites would yield clues that might help them identify and arrest those responsible for the attacks.
"The most important statement I can make, however, is the implacable resolve of the Metropolitan Police service to track down those who are responsible for these terrible events," Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair said at a news conference.
Flanked by other world leaders in Scotland on Friday, Tony Blair said, "We are convinced that the politics we represent will win and triumph over terror."
A senior British investigator said Friday that the authorities initially feared "hundreds of people" might have been killed, and he said they were both surprised and relieved by the relatively low death toll.
Before the meeting, Clarke said European nations had to defend their values of society "against those who would destroy it."
But Clarke, the home secretary, argued that civil rights had to be balanced against the needs of security.
"These were not the amateurs; they only made one mistake and we're very, very lucky."
"I am sure that my employees have nothing to do with terrorists," he said.
The news would seem to come as some relief to many Italians, worried that the suspect's choice of Italy as a place of refuge suggested a network of sympathizers or terror cells that could carry out an attack here.
Aswat has reportedly boasted that he has ties to Osama bin Laden.
"I thank Allah that I was captured by the Taliban and not the Americans," she told her audience.
Some of the cleric's followers were quoted in a newspaper article on Sunday as calling the July 7 bombers "the Fantastic Four.
" Another militant under investigation, Abu Izzadeen, who was born in Britain and is a spokesman for the group Al Ghurabaa, told a British television interviewer that he would not condemn the July 7 bombings, calling them "mujahedeen activity" that would make people "wake up and smell the coffee."
George Galloway, a firebrand legislator viscerally opposed to the war in Iraq and to Blair, told The Sunday Herald that resistance to the American and British occupation of Iraq was "a heroic decision."
"Some are undoubtedly heroic."
In that case, after stumbling through a disorienting day, Bush entered what many of his aides believe were the finest hours of his presidency, leading the country in mourning and than rallying it toward a retaliatory war against al-Qaida.
The recording industry in the United States hailed the ruling as a "global victory."
And that's a very important question.
"I also want people in America to understand how hard people are working to save lives down there not only in New Orleans, but surrounding parishes and along the Gulf Coast," he said.
Sen.Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who has joined scores of other politicians from the region in criticizing the federal response, expressed appreciation for Bush's concession.
"The president's comments today will do more to move our country forward with this tragedy than anything that has been said by any leader in the past two weeks," she said.
"We need a Katrina reconstruction commission headed by a no-nonsense, nonpolitical, businessman manager so that we all have something lasting to show for this spending," Vitter said.
Vitter said he had spent most of the last two weeks in the stricken region, where he said local leaders and private individuals had responded more decisively and quickly than state or federal agencies.
Skinner said he had no reason to believe there was anything wrong with the no-bid contracts, "but we're going to be looking at all of the contracting, the decision-making that was used to determine a sole-source contract.
" "We want validation and we want documentation to show that it was rational to go one way or the other" in offering a no-bid contract, he said.
That money, when added to the office's regular annual budget of about $82 million, would allow his staff to have a "good start" in preventing abuse resulting from the hurricane-relief effort, he said.
"I'm not saying that's all we're going to need, but it's a good start," he said.
The man President Bush had praised days earlier already had been sent home from the hurricane zone, so the resignation was clearly the right thing to do.
Hugo was bad, but it did not affect as many people or jurisdictions, and citizens benefited because Charleston was blessed with a top-rate mayor, Joe Riley.
"Brownie" stepping aside is a step in the right direction, but the issue is bigger than FEMA.
The most conservative estimates are in the 7 million to 10 million range, and a WHO official said that's more realistic than the direst predictions.
The feat is a scientific tour de force that should provide important insights on the best way to respond to the avian influenza strain now circulating in Asia.
"It was impressively well done," said Dr. Richard Brown, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization.
The report, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said that banning large gatherings and imposing quarantines would likely be necessary in order to contain the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus if it mutated into a form easily spread by human-to-human contact.
But the findings do not mean that governments around the world should stop stockpiling hundreds of millions of doses of Tamiflu for use in the event of an influenza pandemic caused by the A (H5N1) avian influenza virus, said the organization's expert, Dr.Keiji Fukuda.
Despite resistance, Tamiflu can still be useful for many people, Fukuda said in a telephone interview from his office in Geneva.
Although the report involved a small number of cases, it was "a good basis for learning" about the use of Tamiflu in avian influenza, Reddy said.
McClintock's closest friends in the Senate have endorsed Schwarzenegger, saying he has the best chance to win.
Talk radio hosts, conservative Republican clubs and taxpayer organizations are backing Schwarzenegger.
Thursday, the businessman Bill Simon endorsed Schwarzenegger, as did the state's Republican county chairmen.
``Arnold has the only chance of winning,'' said Tracy K.Price, president of the Lincoln Club of Orange County.
``I'm closer philosophically to Tom.
``Arnold has a lot of respect for Tom,'' said his spokesman Rob Stutzman.
``I'm proud of Tom,'' Haynes said.
``The fact of the matter is, it was a compliment.
But Huffington, sipping a Starbucks extra grande (``It's caffeinated,'' she said with a smile), said Thursday that she has received an ``absolutely amazing'' outpouring of reaction from women _ 3,000 e-mails so far.
``I identified with her, the whole interrupting thing,'' she said.
He was just defending himself.''
Speaking earlier this week to the Commonwealth Club of California, Shriver said her husband ``always treated me as an equal.
He's respected me.''
``There is no doubt in my mind that if Arnold wins this race, women will be visible in every level of government.
He will fight for equal pay for equal work ...
he will talk about issues that affect women,'' she said.
Love the name, love the ahk-sunt, love, love, love the cinematic oeuvre, especially the early stuff (indeed, my 401K would be a lot more pumped up right now were it not for a certain New Jersey drive-in and its irresistible "Terminator"/"Running Man" double-feature some years ago).
But it's just what's needed to help defuse the situation.
Clearly, he's packing some "vewy impwessive" mental muscle as well.
You'd get far more enjoyment and insight into Schwarzenegger's political psyche by watching "Conan the Barbarian" which, if you recall, includes this bowl of chicken soup for the soul:
While it's hard to knock guys charged with portraying a guy who can't act, there's much more joy in Roland Kickinger's interpretation of the Young Arnold than Jurgen Prochnow's mechanical rendition of the Schwarzenegger we know today.
That's the kindest evaluation one can give to the German actor's crumpled, pockmarked mug in comparison to Arnold's.
"We've really tried to do a good job. ...
the fundamental principle is the guy loves this whole thing."
But the accident is likely to further shake confidence in nuclear power, just as high oil prices and the Iraq war are making nuclear power more attractive to economic planners.
He added that the government would respond "resolutely, after confirming the facts."
In an interview Monday, Progress Florida president and chief executive Bill Habermeyer said that nuclear power's lack of carbon emissions and its ability to potentially reduce American dependency on foreign energy sources give it significant advantages.
"When you look at the choices ahead, I think nuclear provides a better alternative," he said.
But Jia appeared to soften China's usual harsh line against Taiwan's president, Chen Shui-bian, a shift that seemed more about tone than about substance:
At an evening news conference, Wang Zai, vice minister of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, described Jia's speech as a "clearer and more specific" description of China's stance toward Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party.
Lin Yinhong, the general manager of a business group that is the de facto chamber of commerce for Taiwanese businesses in Beijing, said the flights represented a significant breakthrough in relations and a welcome convenience for the estimated 1 million Taiwanese living in China.
He also said direct routes would cut costs for businesses.
In his speech, Jia noted the importance of maintaining the peaceful conditions that have contributed to China's rise.
Hu said that there were "certain signs of relaxation" in Taiwan's approach to the mainland.
Fat, he said, was harmless.
It was Ancel Keys, paradoxically, who introduced the low-fat-is-good-health dogma in the '50s with his theory that dietary fat raises cholesterol levels and gives you heart disease.
Now researchers have finally decided that Atkins' diet and other low-carb diets have to be tested, and are doing so against traditional low-calorie, low-fat diets as recommended by the American Heart Association.
``The novelty is fun, and these diets do work for a very limited time.
Now, a healthy slice of New York's high society is hooked on Atkins, including the jet-setting sisters Alexandra Von Furstenberg and Marie-Chantal of Greece, who swear by it.
Samantha Boardman, a regular on the New York-Palm Beach circuit, was so taken by the whole Atkins lifestyle that she briefly considered dropping out of her psychiatry residency at the New York University Medical School to work as an apprentice to the creator of the diet, Dr.Robert C.Atkins, at the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine on the East Side.
``Visually, she looked really good.
She lost a lot of weight, and that inspired the rest of us.
Jennifer Aniston is the most outspoken one, but Cindy Crawford, Kristin Davis and Courtney Love have also been in the Zone tribe, adhering to the diet's allowance of meals with carefully measured proportions of protein and carbohydrate that are prepared and delivered to each participant's home every day in black plastic boxes (at $4.95 each).
Luna, who recently dropped 15 pounds on a diet he concocted himself, swears by the oldest diet trick in the book: eat less.
Everyone laughed at me, but even my brother, who is really a bacon cheeseburger kind of guy, now loves the food.''
For the record, both believe that simply eating less and moving more will do the trick.
What's cool is that this is one of the few low-carb diets vegetarians can follow (tofu is accepted with open arms!).
But Mahan gives the thumbs up to Ornish's holistic approach to health.
It's the more manageable cousin to the raw food diet, in which nothing is heated to more than 116 degrees (devotees include Donna Karan and Demi Moore).
Expert opinion: Drewnowski -- ``I like the soup component.
Mahan -- ``The advantage of it is that it's so tremendously high in vegetables which are high in phytonutrients (antioxidants that stimulate the immune system) and they protect the body against oxidation,'' said Mahan, explaining that cells are damaged when exposed to oxygen and to free radicals (think of oxygen interacting with iron, causing it to rust).
Expert opinion: Mahan -- ``It's very popular, and that's because it's reasonable.
I really think the Zone diet and that approach is a good one,'' said Mahan.
Drewnowski -- This is essentially a sane and balanced diet, said Drewnowski, if a little expensive.
When it comes to evaluating claims for weight-loss products, the Federal Trade Commission recommends a healthy portion of skepticism.
It's not clear if Horace Fletcher's diet plan played more to obsessive behavior or people's weight loss desire, but in the 1910s, "The Great Masticator" advocated chewing each bite of food at least 32 times.
``I've always loved the atmosphere of the village,'' said Rogge, who stayed there three times as a sailor for Belgium and five more as delegation leader . . .
I know the Olympics hasn't stolen my soul at all.
``I think there is a great connection we can make with kids,'' said Lloyd Ward, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
``I'm glad I got to see the beginning, and I got to see the punk delinquents who weren't accepted become big, and that I got to be a part of it.
``I think the Olympics are great,'' Thomas said.
``I don't think it's bad at all.
I have huge respect for guys who compete in the X Games and what they do.
They have unbelievable talent.
``I never thought in a million years that I would be able to buy things that I'm able to buy.
I'm fortunate to have come into snowboarding when I did.
And I'm grateful for everything I have.
That's when I felt the pride of being an American in an American Olympics.''
Organizers of the 2006 Winter Games in Turin have been impressed with the Salt Lake Olympics but will not attempt any paint-by-number reproductions of these games.
The commercial success of the Salt Lake Games, he said, ``takes away some of the uncertainty after Sept. 11; they give a new starting point to the market.''
``My hope, my expectation in the coming four years is that the world will be better than it is now and will not require the same security,'' he added.
The athletic competition, the raison d'etre for any Olympics, dazzled.
Shea said, ``I can honestly say the friendships are more important than the medals.
``It's worked without people feeling like security was all over them,'' Romney countered.
``Calgary was like that.
Nagano was like that.
``Salt Lake has gone off like clockwork, but this is clockwork with spirit, with heart.
This is the best Olympics I've seen.''
``These games, as a whole, are a great success,'' said Francois Carrard, IOC director general.
``If you talk to the athletes, you will have the confirmation.''
SLOC will have done it with few traffic jams, few reports of serious crime, and with a level of security (at this writing) almost too good to be true in a perilous world.
Romney credits the volunteers here for much of Salt Lake 2002's success, and they certainly have been important.
``The volunteers are creating the face of the games,'' he said, ``and it is a friendly and cooperative face.''
Among U.S. athletes, Sarah Hughes and Derek Parra inspired us.
We were moved by Jim Shea Jr.and intrigued by Apolo Anton Ohno.
Foreign athletes turned in wonderful performances galore.
Bespectacled little Simon Ammann, all 121 pounds of him, looked like Harry Potter but jumped like Carl Lewis, winning two gold medals for Switzerland in ski-jumping.
Such as Germany's Patric-Fritz Leitner suggesting, after he and Alexander Resch won luge doubles gold, ``I never believed that fools like us could win the gold medal at the Olympics.''
Salt Lake 2002 deftly handled commercialism.
We have been both lucky and skilled at these games.''
``I said at the outset that the Salt Lake City Winter Games in prime time would be the equivalent of seven Super Bowls,'' said NBC President Randy Falco.
``As it actually turns out, it's more like eight.''
``I think there's a sense that people are talking about the Olympics now more than perhaps ever before,'' Falco said.
``This has had the highest impact and weight of any major event that we've measured.''
``This has surpassed my wildest expectations,'' said NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol.
Ebersol credits part of the rave ratings to the performance of the U.S. team, giving an assist to an unlikely American hero.
``This is somebody who people bash all the time, but one of the heroes in all this is George Steinbrenner.
A Shanghai newspaper, The Liberation Daily, said the mission would take place in the second half of 2003, calling it a historic breakthrough to a manned space flight program.
``Appropriate in stature, quick in movement and unafraid of hardship, Chinese astronauts are obviously superior,'' Su Shuangning, head of the space program, recently told Chinese reporters.
President Jiang Zemin, the top civilian overseeing the military, called the latest Shenzhou launching a ``great victory'' and urged the military to ``redouble it efforts and work in a pioneering spirit to make more contributions to the peaceful development of outer space.''
In Shanghai, Liberation Daily said the fifth Shenzhou mission, set for the second half of 2003, would be ``a historic breakthrough to a manned space program.''
Jiang Zemin, China's president and the top civilian overseeing the military, has called the latest Shenzhou launching a ``great victory'' and urged the military to ``redouble it efforts'' in the ``peaceful development of outer space.''
``Appropriate in stature, quick in movement and unafraid of hardship, Chinese astronauts are obviously superior,'' Su Shuangning, head of the space program, told Chinese reporters recently.
The astronaut, Lt.Col.Yang Liwei, is being hailed as a national hero and lavished with praise by the country's top leaders.
``It is a splendid moment in the history of my motherland and also the greatest day of my life,'' Yang, a former military fighter pilot, said minutes after landing, according to the official New China News Agency.
``The scenery was very beautiful,'' he said.
However tacky and concocted the Soviet propaganda about his feat, Gagarin was a genuine pioneer and a genuine hero, a charming country boy who became, at only 27, the first human being to orbit Earth, and that at a time, 42 years ago, when it was not at all certain that he would survive.
China's Divine Vessel 5 is no doubt an impressive capsule, and further evidence of China's steady ascent up the ladder of economic and technological prowess.
Bush also voiced ``confidence'' in Rumsfeld in the televised interviews.
Given the ECB's inflation target of ``below 2 percent,'' which can be interpreted as a range of 0 percent to 2 percent, most economists reckon that interest rates in the euro area are about right.
"The speed of the euro's appreciation has come down somewhat, so they are a bit more relaxed."
"The first years were the best for us," said Martin Sauer, the owner of an optical shop, referring to the period after 1989, when the Iron Curtain fell.
The euro's recent decline versus the dollar, he added, was not a bad thing since it would help European exporters regain their edge in foreign markets.
A poll taken late last month by the Forsa organization for Stern magazine found 56 percent of Germans preferred to return to the mark.
Meanwhile, a poll by the German weekly Stern shows that a majority of Germans want to move back to the German mark.
"Everywhere I go, I find support," Maroni said.
But the euro should be seen as a productive constraint obliging the development of a high-tech service sector and forcing family firms to innovate."
Her organization, Imaginary Lines in San Diego, organizes science fairs for girls, workshops for teachers and vacation camps where girls learn, as Ride says, ``that science is really cool.''
We're hoping that in the future there might be an independent technical organization within NASA with its own resources that will give engineers a venue to help them develop data for their arguments.
With human space flight, you'd better add the word ``safety'' in there, too, because if upper management is going ``faster, better, cheaper,'' that percolates down, and it puts the emphasis on meeting schedules and improving the way that you do things and on cost.
That's a very good record for a launch vehicle.
I like the shuttle.
People at lower levels are also indicating that they are getting more comfortable communicating with their superiors, he said.
Readdy said that engineers had made great progress in changing the way foam is applied to the fuel tank, and how the work is inspected.
"I give them a passing grade, over all," he said in an interview, adding that the board's goal was "breaking the chain" of problems that led to foam falling off the fuel tank and striking Columbia.
In a briefing last month with reporters, Col.Eileen M.Collins of the Air Force, the commander for the coming shuttle flight, said simply, "If it wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it."
Nonetheless, the task group credited the space agency with making significant strides since the Columbia tragedy, noting that NASA had satisfied 12 of the 15 findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.
"While we can say in our opinion NASA has not met the (Columbia Accident Investigation Board's) intent, we are saying they have made significant progress.
At a news conference punctuated by the rolling thunder of a summer downpour of the kind that could well cause launching delays, Griffin and other NASA officials expressed ebullient confidence in their agency and their craft.
He added: "We honestly believe this is the cleanest flight we have ever done.
Griffin said he was delighted with the task group's report, which he said simply acknowledged how difficult the challenges were.
"We are being as smart about this as we know how to be, but we are up against the limits of our human knowledge," he said.
John M.Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and a member of the accident investigation board, called the planned launching "an absolutely essential step to creating forward momentum" for the space program.
More than 150,000 watched the fiery launch from nearby roadways and rooftops, marking the start of what NASA hopes to be a new era of confidence in space flight and more daring solar system travel.
"Today, Mother Nature smiled on us and I think the Columbia crew smiled on us too," said NASA associate administrator William Readdy.
While gleeful about the 10:39 a.m. launch, NASA officials were noticeably cautious, saying they will not know for several days whether enormous efforts to protect Discovery from the problems that doomed Columbia were successful - and would not celebrate until the vehicle safely lands in the early morning hours of Aug. 7.
Along Florida's Space Coast - and across the country - adults and children wished the astronauts a safe journey.
"I was crossing my fingers that they were going to make it," said Lisa Steck, 44, a third-grade teacher in Framingham, closing her eyes.
"I think it's fantastic that we just sent someone up again."
"We've learned a lot about ourselves."
In an interview, Rocha said he was enjoying the greater role that engineering now plays in meetings.
"Engineering is more independent than ever, more assertive than ever," he said, "and more in your face.
``I don't believe that America will justifiably make an unprovoked attack on another nation,'' Armey said.
``It could be a cakewalk,'' Eland said.
He also sought to assure a gathering of some supporters and many Western reporters that America's intentions in Iraq were not hostile.
``That is the policy of the United States, that's what President Bush has said, and I believe him.''
"I think their service was honorable.
And when you talk to the majority of their brothers, the young soldiers out there fighting the fight, they want us to finish this mission," Webster said.
Airlines have been saying that the filters aboard modern planes do a good job of removing viruses from the air.
Doctors here had also been insisting until Sunday that their treatments for SARS were broadly effective, and they hidqsed this as an incentive for people to enter hospitals when they felt sick.
The international experts, based on their limited work, say they are impressed by Beijing's careful care of patients in specially designated hospitals, and its strengthened efforts to trace and isolate those who have been in close contact with SARS patients.
But I can prevent.''
And health officials are being particularly diligent in monitoring for the disease in offices in Asian neighborhoods, Romney says.
Herbal medicines, Chinesm Madicine proponents say, help boost the body's immune system, which they say can then better fight off the coronavirus that researchers say causes SARS.
It has confidence in its pronouncements, Stoehr said, because it has placed international teams of experts in affected areas to monitor how well local health officials are keeping track of SARS and controlling its spread.
``China used to do a very good job with very little money,'' said Jing Jun, a professor of sociology at Tsinghua University.
You just need vigorous supervision and management,'' Yip said.
``We need to use gene-amplification techniques to look for the SARS virus in respiratory secretions,'' Burke said.
Burke said that there is no definitive evidence to prove that the virus will return, but that surveillance must be conducted to make sure no stone is left un-turned.
Grant said the travel industry had been extraordinarily helpful in isolating travelers that the CDC had pinpointed as potential public health risks because of their exposure to SARS.
``There's still so much unknown, and it's hard to predict when the next wave will be _ we need to have the proper mechanisms in place,'' he said.
On the other hand, some said the blackout, which interrupted production at automobile factories around Detroit, might trim excessive inventories that have been filling dealers' lots.
Bloomberg said Con Edison had ``done as good a job as could be hoped for.
But Cambridge Energy said on Friday that it had access to a more complete set of data and other information and that it believed its scenario was the most thorough yet to emerge.
Stauffer, the Cambridge Energy researcher, said of the theory, ``I think this one is supported by the facts.
And several officials from industry groups charged with preventing blackouts in various regions around the grid said that the analysis did seem consistent with information they had collected so far.
The old system was better able to ensure a stable electricity supply because it was easier for government to regulate, said David Hughes, executive director of Citizen Power, a Pennsylvania-based consumer group.
Another witness, Elizabeth A.Moler, executive vice president of Exelon, which operates Commonweath Edison and the Philadelphia Electric Co., said, however, that changes were needed to prevent future blackouts.
Enforceable reliability standards, such as those in the energy bill currently before the Senate, would help prevent future blackouts, said Abraham.
In the taped conversations, Ahmed calls himself "the thread behind the Madrid plot," discusses an imminent terrorist operation in an unidentified location and the deployment of suicide martyrs to Iraq, and complains about his marriage and money problems.
He boasts that while the Americans possess nuclear weapons, he has seen "something in the form of a hair dryer" that causes "the most horrible death possible" by suffocation.
From the point of view of the Italians, their handling of the case -- from the discovery and monitoring of Ahmed to a flood of information they passed on to Spanish investigators even before his arrest -- is evidence of first-rate police work and bilateral cooperation in the fight against terrorism.
"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful America," said Bush, 58, a former governor of Texas who has battled a troubled domestic economy and waged wars in Afghanistan and Iraq during 43 months in office.
Bush said he was running with a "compassionate conservative philosophy" that calls for the federal government to "help people improve their lives_not try to run their lives."
"We are making progress and there is more to do," Bush said.
"This young century will be liberty's century,"Bush promised.
"I have seen courage and consistency_the courage to stand up to terrorists and the consistency to beat them," said Franks.
Kerry cited Cheney by name, saying that voters would decide whether Cheney's five draft deferments during the Vietnam war make "someone more qualified to defend this nation than two tours of duty."
Gerald Austin of Cleveland, a leading Ohio campaign consultant for more than 30 years, said that former President Bill Clinton could run a better campaign than Kerry's "even when he was under ether.
Bennett called it "a textbook campaign, with everyone pulling together -- national, state and local -- maybe the best I've been involved in."
"He likes the Hermes tie.
When Kerry needs a chief executive look, he favors dark, two-button classics made by Southwick Clothing near Boston -- as he did during the Democratic convention.
Bush prefers the handmade look of Oxxford Clothes in Chicago.
He wore a pink tie in the primaries, and that helped.
"In a close election, knowing that 93 percent of a person's effectiveness as a communicator is judged on style, not content, we can expect appearance to play a large role," McClarie said.
"I like to get out with the people," Bush told the crowd in Ohio, one of the crucial battleground states that will help decide the November election.
"I like to tell people where I stand."
Clothes matched his message, supporters said.
"It brings it down to where you think he's on your level.
"He got right down with the people," said the 52-year-old Carr, the wife of a mine worker.
Ninety-eight percent of America is going to get a tax cut under my plan."
Bush's supporters believe in him too much for that.
That is not to say that Bush's supporters do not enjoy the fanfare around his visits, which are ticketed events overseen by local Republican officials.
"We are here for him," said Janet Pavlik, who endured three hours of traffic and security checks before seeing the president at a farm in Bucks County, Pa.
This is to show our support, for him to see our support, for everyone to see our support."
Trybulec said their attendance was a show of solidarity.
"He is not going to convince anyone today, but for me personally it is important to be here."
People who know him well describe a steely resolve.
"You have lifted our spirits."
Even in crowds of many thousands, people said they felt drawn closer to Bush by the interaction.
Edmund Eisnaugle, a physician from Niles, Ohio, who attended a Bush rally at an airport in nearby Vienna, said he appreciated the president's plain approach.
"He has softened his tone a lot and gotten a lot more personal," Eisnaugle said of the president.
"He is really connecting with people.
We are in a crisis in this country, and I really sense George Bush is the man who can bring us together."
"He gets it," Rove said of the president.
"There's just something refreshing about giving it your all and then saying the people will make the right decision," Bush told reporters after casting his ballot.
"I don't think anybody can anticipate what it's like to see your name on the ballot for president," said Kerry.
"It's very special.
It's exciting."
"The hour is late and time is short," said Stevens, appointed in 1975 by President Gerald Ford, adding that he had "faith" that election officials "will enable qualified voters to cast their ballots."
Young voters have "changed this country before and they could change this country again," Edwards said on CBS News' "Early Show.
" "If these folks participate and there's a big turnout, we feel very optimistic."
"You know," he said outside his polling place in Crawford, Texas, "there's just something refreshing about giving it your all and then saying the people will make the right decision.
And I believe I'm going to win."
And he believed the election would turn -- in his favor -- on the signature issue that was forced on him early in his administration, the war on terror.
"There are very troubling times, and I believe a president must lead by being resolute and firm and strong and clear," he said.
"And the people know that.
That's why I'm comfortable about this election."
"We're revved up and this gives us an extra push," volunteer Melissa Sharp said of the presidential drop-by.
Outside the Columbus headquarters, Bush said his spirits remained high.
The day, to that point, was a success, he said.
"We had a long night -- and a great night," Bush said.
He said the president had run "forthrightly on a clear agenda for this nation's future, and the nation responded by giving him a mandate."
"To make this nation stronger and better, I will need your support and I will work to earn it.
They ran a very effective campaign and he won.
Tracy Dahlby, a longtime Asia hand, notes in a new book about Indonesia, "Allah's Torch," that at least one poll shows that roughly 75 percent of Indonesians had good feelings about the United States in 2000 -- a period that followed the American intervention in the Asian financial crisis and the forced resignation of President Suharto.
"I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help," he said of the $35 million that the administration has pledged so far.
"I assured those leaders this is only the beginning of our help."
No, we're a very generous, kindhearted nation."
Though it was difficult to calculate a dollar figure, the public's response to the disaster has been generous, said Mary E.McClymont, chief executive of InterAction, the largest alliance of U.S.-based private humanitarian agencies.
"The good news is coming in by the hour," Egeland said in New York.
After days of red tape, washed out roads and bridges and other problems, substantial help was finally getting through, officials said.
Michael Elmquist, coordinator of the U.N. relief operations in Indonesia, said major progress had been made, both in distributing supplies that had piled up at the regional airports and in evacuating many people who had been left homeless and cut off by the destruction of roads and communications.
Eric Fernando, a spokesman for Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, said that international aid had been abundant, but that there was a pressing need for water-purification equipment.
Hastert, a former high school wrestling coach who has often been characterized as an affable sidekick to House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and tax code reform.

Nevertheless, she is eager to return.
"I believe Aceh will change," he said.
Still, he is hopeful that the era of bloodshed is over.
"Right now, all the Christians are more concerned about humanity," he said.
The tsunami makes everybody want to do things for Aceh."
"I still think God is a good God," Rompis said.
"It's been a great success so far," Wolfowitz said of the relief effort, "it's important to sustain it."
Wolfowitz, who recently visited Indonesia, the most populous Islamic country on earth, said the massive U.S. aid has helped this country's image across the Muslim world, where anti-American sentiment has been fueled by the war in Iraq.
"Leading this training was a life-changing experience," he said.
"They're amazing people," he said.
They have a remarkable ability to put the loss behind them and move forward."
Better information, he said, can save lives and speed the recovery.
"It seems like a natural to me."
Bush's science adviser, John H. Marburger III, defended the president's approach to climate change, saying it ``is not, as some commenters have cynically remarked, to delay action, but to act in a rational and responsible way.''
"Russia will benefit from a great wealth transfer as EU funds flow into the country in exchange for rights to Russian carbon dioxide allowances," Institute President William O'Keefe said.
It would be far better now to adopt "no regrets" policies -- measures that will benefit all of humanity whether global warming turns out to be a problem or not.
Nathan Mantua, assistant director of the Center for Science in the Earth System at the University of Washington, which estimates the impact of global warming on the Northwest, said the coalition's efforts were laudable, but probably of limited global impact.
"It is clearly a politically significant step in the right direction," Mantua said.
But many of the mayors said they were acting precisely out of concern for the economic vitality of their cities.
"The Japanese government must understand that China is not a weak country now.
"This is our May 4 movement," said Wei Bing, a graduate student in computer sciences.
Asked by a reporter whether anything could be done to rein in the attack on the consulate, a Chinese officer answered, "By whom?" and then walked away as if annoyed.
"The Chinese government has never done anything for which it has to apologize to the Japanese people," Li said.
Declaring themselves to be all one people, the demonstrators proclaimed their love of the police who escorted them as they marched to the consulate, smashing Japanese shops along the way.
Banners extolled Chinese greatness, in contrast to little Japan; chanters called for their homeland to stand tall; and talk was dominated by Chinese "feelings," a word repeated over and over, as if no other feelings counted.
On Friday, government officials testily defended the education curriculum.
"Patriotic education is not anti-Japan education," said Qin Gang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, according to state media.
The general consensus among terror experts is that the attacks were carried out by a group of "home grown terrorists" from Europe who feel alienated and see radical Islam as a way out of poverty.
"We felt it was appropriate, bearing in mind all the intelligence that we were in possession of," he said.
"We are content that the security system was appropriate, notwithstanding the G-8 summit that was happening in Scotland."
Officials said they were confident that the forensic investigation collected at the four sites would yield clues that might help them identify and arrest those responsible for the attacks.
"The most important statement I can make, however, is the implacable resolve of the Metropolitan Police service to track down those who are responsible for these terrible events," Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair said at a news conference.
Flanked by other world leaders in Scotland on Friday, Tony Blair said, "We are convinced that the politics we represent will win and triumph over terror."
A senior British investigator said Friday that the authorities initially feared "hundreds of people" might have been killed, and he said they were both surprised and relieved by the relatively low death toll.
"I thank Allah that I was captured by the Taliban and not the Americans," she told her audience.
"Islam forbids the use of violence against innocent people," he said.
Some of the cleric's followers were quoted in a newspaper article on Sunday as calling the July 7 bombers "the Fantastic Four.
" Another militant under investigation, Abu Izzadeen, who was born in Britain and is a spokesman for the group Al Ghurabaa, told a British television interviewer that he would not condemn the July 7 bombings, calling them "mujahedeen activity" that would make people "wake up and smell the coffee."
George Galloway, a firebrand legislator viscerally opposed to the war in Iraq and to Blair, told The Sunday Herald that resistance to the American and British occupation of Iraq was "a heroic decision."
"Some are undoubtedly heroic."
In that case, after stumbling through a disorienting day, Bush entered what many of his aides believe were the finest hours of his presidency, leading the country in mourning and than rallying it toward a retaliatory war against al-Qaida.
The recording industry in the United States hailed the ruling as a "global victory."
And that's a very important question.
Even as he acknowledged problems, Bush praised Coast Guard and other rescue teams in the devastated area.
Sen.Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat who has joined scores of other politicians from the region in criticizing the federal response, expressed appreciation for Bush's concession.
"The president's comments today will do more to move our country forward with this tragedy than anything that has been said by any leader in the past two weeks," she said.
"We need a Katrina reconstruction commission headed by a no-nonsense, nonpolitical, businessman manager so that we all have something lasting to show for this spending," Vitter said.
Vitter said he had spent most of the last two weeks in the stricken region, where he said local leaders and private individuals had responded more decisively and quickly than state or federal agencies.
That money, when added to the office's regular annual budget of about $82 million, would allow his staff to have a "good start" in preventing abuse resulting from the hurricane-relief effort, he said.
"I'm not saying that's all we're going to need, but it's a good start," he said.
The man President Bush had praised days earlier already had been sent home from the hurricane zone, so the resignation was clearly the right thing to do.
Hugo was bad, but it did not affect as many people or jurisdictions, and citizens benefited because Charleston was blessed with a top-rate mayor, Joe Riley.
The most conservative estimates are in the 7 million to 10 million range, and a WHO official said that's more realistic than the direst predictions.
"It was impressively well done," said Dr. Richard Brown, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization.
The report, by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said that banning large gatherings and imposing quarantines would likely be necessary in order to contain the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus if it mutated into a form easily spread by human-to-human contact.
Despite resistance, Tamiflu can still be useful for many people, Fukuda said in a telephone interview from his office in Geneva.
Although the report involved a small number of cases, it was "a good basis for learning" about the use of Tamiflu in avian influenza, Reddy said.
McClintock's closest friends in the Senate have endorsed Schwarzenegger, saying he has the best chance to win.
Talk radio hosts, conservative Republican clubs and taxpayer organizations are backing Schwarzenegger.
Thursday, the businessman Bill Simon endorsed Schwarzenegger, as did the state's Republican county chairmen.
``Arnold has the only chance of winning,'' said Tracy K.Price, president of the Lincoln Club of Orange County.
``I'm closer philosophically to Tom.
He is enjoying the limelight, by his own admission.
``Arnold has a lot of respect for Tom,'' said his spokesman Rob Stutzman.
The people I have always appealed to are the rank-and-file voters of this state, and they have been responding from the very first day when I was an asterisk.''
``I'm proud of Tom,'' Haynes said.
Tom is not suicidal.
Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, trying to make light of his cutting remarks to Arianna Huffington at Wednesday's gubernatorial debate, said Thursday he was only giving her a ``compliment'' when he told her, ``I have a perfect part for you in `Terminator 4''' and ``You need a little more decaf.''
``The fact of the matter is, it was a compliment.
``I had no idea that `the woman thing' would be an issue,'' Huffington, an Independent candidate for governor, said in an interview in San Francisco.
``I identified with her, the whole interrupting thing,'' she said.
He was just defending himself.''
Speaking earlier this week to the Commonwealth Club of California, Shriver said her husband ``always treated me as an equal.
He's respected me.''
``There is no doubt in my mind that if Arnold wins this race, women will be visible in every level of government.
He will fight for equal pay for equal work ...
he will talk about issues that affect women,'' she said.
Love the name, love the ahk-sunt, love, love, love the cinematic oeuvre, especially the early stuff (indeed, my 401K would be a lot more pumped up right now were it not for a certain New Jersey drive-in and its irresistible "Terminator"/"Running Man" double-feature some years ago).
Clearly, he's packing some "vewy impwessive" mental muscle as well.
You'd get far more enjoyment and insight into Schwarzenegger's political psyche by watching "Conan the Barbarian" which, if you recall, includes this bowl of chicken soup for the soul:
The first concerns the all-importance of tenacity, observed in the young Arnold's hunger for success beyond all ideas of success, his mantra of being bigger, faster, stronger, his declaration to the world that he is Zeus.
He added that the government would respond "resolutely, after confirming the facts."
In an interview Monday, Progress Florida president and chief executive Bill Habermeyer said that nuclear power's lack of carbon emissions and its ability to potentially reduce American dependency on foreign energy sources give it significant advantages.
"When you look at the choices ahead, I think nuclear provides a better alternative," he said.
Lin Yinhong, the general manager of a business group that is the de facto chamber of commerce for Taiwanese businesses in Beijing, said the flights represented a significant breakthrough in relations and a welcome convenience for the estimated 1 million Taiwanese living in China.
He also said direct routes would cut costs for businesses.
In his speech, Jia noted the importance of maintaining the peaceful conditions that have contributed to China's rise.
Hu said that there were "certain signs of relaxation" in Taiwan's approach to the mainland.
Fat, he said, was harmless.
Now a small but growing minority of establishment researchers have come to take seriously what the low-carb-diet doctors have been saying all along.
It was Ancel Keys, paradoxically, who introduced the low-fat-is-good-health dogma in the '50s with his theory that dietary fat raises cholesterol levels and gives you heart disease.
Now researchers have finally decided that Atkins' diet and other low-carb diets have to be tested, and are doing so against traditional low-calorie, low-fat diets as recommended by the American Heart Association.
Samantha Boardman, a regular on the New York-Palm Beach circuit, was so taken by the whole Atkins lifestyle that she briefly considered dropping out of her psychiatry residency at the New York University Medical School to work as an apprentice to the creator of the diet, Dr.Robert C.Atkins, at the Atkins Center for Complementary Medicine on the East Side.
``Visually, she looked really good.
She lost a lot of weight, and that inspired the rest of us.
That was the case for Gwyneth Paltrow, who, after five bouts with a nasty flu virus, decided it was time to take steps.
Everyone laughed at me, but even my brother, who is really a bacon cheeseburger kind of guy, now loves the food.''
For the record, both believe that simply eating less and moving more will do the trick.
``The advantage of it is that it doesn't take things away from people.
That said, he adds that ``over-fed males of 50'' with high cholesterol levels and other cardiac issues will benefit from Ornish's diet.
But Mahan gives the thumbs up to Ornish's holistic approach to health.
Expert opinion: Drewnowski -- ``I like the soup component.
Mahan -- ``The advantage of it is that it's so tremendously high in vegetables which are high in phytonutrients (antioxidants that stimulate the immune system) and they protect the body against oxidation,'' said Mahan, explaining that cells are damaged when exposed to oxygen and to free radicals (think of oxygen interacting with iron, causing it to rust).
Expert opinion: Mahan -- ``It's very popular, and that's because it's reasonable.
I really think the Zone diet and that approach is a good one,'' said Mahan.
The Zone is also good because ``it forces people to look at the protein content in their diet -- and most people eat way too many carbs.''
Drewnowski -- This is essentially a sane and balanced diet, said Drewnowski, if a little expensive.
``I've always loved the atmosphere of the village,'' said Rogge, who stayed there three times as a sailor for Belgium and five more as delegation leader . . .
I know the Olympics hasn't stolen my soul at all.
``I think there is a great connection we can make with kids,'' said Lloyd Ward, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
But they were also the same officials who were desperate to introduce snowboarding at the 1998 Nagano Games after watching participation levels double while skiing lost ground.
``However, the IOC must also innovate and adapt to the constantly changing wishes and needs of young people.''
``I'm glad I got to see the beginning, and I got to see the punk delinquents who weren't accepted become big, and that I got to be a part of it.
``I think the Olympics are great,'' Thomas said.
``I don't think it's bad at all.
I have huge respect for guys who compete in the X Games and what they do.
They have unbelievable talent.
``I never thought in a million years that I would be able to buy things that I'm able to buy.
I'm fortunate to have come into snowboarding when I did.
And I'm grateful for everything I have.
By the end of the two weeks that followed, Americans were feeling more at home than ever at a Winter Olympics, relishing their mastery in new-age sports that spawned a record haul of 30 medals through Friday's events, broadened interest in the Winter Games and boosted television ratings by nearly 20 percent.
The breakdown of collegiality began three days into the games, when the Canadian figure skating pairs team of David Pelletier and Jamie Sale were denied a gold medal victory that many people thought they had earned.
For most Americans, however, these were the Winter Games that worked.
Organizers of the 2006 Winter Games in Turin have been impressed with the Salt Lake Olympics but will not attempt any paint-by-number reproductions of these games.
The commercial success of the Salt Lake Games, he said, ``takes away some of the uncertainty after Sept. 11; they give a new starting point to the market.''
Shea said, ``I can honestly say the friendships are more important than the medals.
It's all about the medals, winning, the Russian delegation all but screamed Thursday.
They also pressed for a gold for the Russian women's cross-country relay team, which lost nine-time Olympic medalist and national heroine Larissa Lazutina for high levels of hemoglobin.
``It's worked without people feeling like security was all over them,'' Romney countered.
Friday, he thought about it for a second and said, ``I think we have to.''
Salt Lake takes home the gold.
And that is an upset almost as big as Sarah Hughes winning the women's skating gold.
``Calgary was like that.
Nagano was like that.
``Salt Lake has gone off like clockwork, but this is clockwork with spirit, with heart.
This is the best Olympics I've seen.''
``These games, as a whole, are a great success,'' said Francois Carrard, IOC director general.
``If you talk to the athletes, you will have the confirmation.''
Romney credits the volunteers here for much of Salt Lake 2002's success, and they certainly have been important.
``The volunteers are creating the face of the games,'' he said, ``and it is a friendly and cooperative face.''
Among U.S. athletes, Sarah Hughes and Derek Parra inspired us.
We were moved by Jim Shea Jr.and intrigued by Apolo Anton Ohno.
Foreign athletes turned in wonderful performances galore.
Bespectacled little Simon Ammann, all 121 pounds of him, looked like Harry Potter but jumped like Carl Lewis, winning two gold medals for Switzerland in ski-jumping.
Such as Germany's Patric-Fritz Leitner suggesting, after he and Alexander Resch won luge doubles gold, ``I never believed that fools like us could win the gold medal at the Olympics.''
Salt Lake 2002 deftly handled commercialism.
It gave the world a grand party in times of global anxiety and doubt.
We have been both lucky and skilled at these games.''
``I said at the outset that the Salt Lake City Winter Games in prime time would be the equivalent of seven Super Bowls,'' said NBC President Randy Falco.
``As it actually turns out, it's more like eight.''
``I think there's a sense that people are talking about the Olympics now more than perhaps ever before,'' Falco said.
``This has had the highest impact and weight of any major event that we've measured.''
``This has surpassed my wildest expectations,'' said NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol.
Ebersol credits part of the rave ratings to the performance of the U.S. team, giving an assist to an unlikely American hero.
``When you think that they [the United States] have 34 medals, when the most they've ever won is 13, that says a lot,'' Ebersol said.
A Shanghai newspaper, The Liberation Daily, said the mission would take place in the second half of 2003, calling it a historic breakthrough to a manned space flight program.
``Appropriate in stature, quick in movement and unafraid of hardship, Chinese astronauts are obviously superior,'' Su Shuangning, head of the space program, recently told Chinese reporters.
President Jiang Zemin, the top civilian overseeing the military, called the latest Shenzhou launching a ``great victory'' and urged the military to ``redouble it efforts and work in a pioneering spirit to make more contributions to the peaceful development of outer space.''
In Shanghai, Liberation Daily said the fifth Shenzhou mission, set for the second half of 2003, would be ``a historic breakthrough to a manned space program.''
Jiang Zemin, China's president and the top civilian overseeing the military, has called the latest Shenzhou launching a ``great victory'' and urged the military to ``redouble it efforts'' in the ``peaceful development of outer space.''
``Appropriate in stature, quick in movement and unafraid of hardship, Chinese astronauts are obviously superior,'' Su Shuangning, head of the space program, told Chinese reporters recently.
The astronaut, Lt.Col.Yang Liwei, is being hailed as a national hero and lavished with praise by the country's top leaders.
``It is a splendid moment in the history of my motherland and also the greatest day of my life,'' Yang, a former military fighter pilot, said minutes after landing, according to the official New China News Agency.
``The scenery was very beautiful,'' he said.
However tacky and concocted the Soviet propaganda about his feat, Gagarin was a genuine pioneer and a genuine hero, a charming country boy who became, at only 27, the first human being to orbit Earth, and that at a time, 42 years ago, when it was not at all certain that he would survive.
Bush also voiced ``confidence'' in Rumsfeld in the televised interviews.
